# Naming & Concept Analysis

## Naming Brainstorm
*Goal: A name that showcases "everchanging destiny," "irresponsible magicians," and the "living board."*

### Thematic Keywords
*   **Motion**: Drift, Flux, Orbit, Turn, Shift, Wander.
*   **Magic**: Weave, Charm, Hex, Gamble, Fate.
*   **Structure**: Circle, Square, Boundary, Horizon, Rim.
*   **Time**: Ephemera, Echo, Tide, Cycle.

### Top Contenders

1.  **The Everturn**
    *   *Why*: Simple, evocative. Implies the board is always turning/changing.
2.  **Orbit & Flux**
    *   *Why*: Directly describes the mechanics (Orbiting the Circle, Flux of the Square).
3.  **Magician's Drift**
    *   *Why*: Captures the "irresponsible" wandering nature of the personas.
4.  **Destiny's Rim**
    *   *Why*: Players walk the "rim" (Circle) to shape the destiny within.
5.  **Kaleidoscope Bounds**
    *   *Why*: The Square is a kaleidoscope; the Circle is the boundary.
6.  **Fickle Fates**
    *   *Why*: Highlights the luck/gambling aspect and the shifting whims of the board.
7.  **Wander & Weave**
    *   *Why*: You wander the outside to weave the inside.
8.  **The Shifted Square**
    *   *Why*: Literal, but mysterious.
9.  **Curio Chasers**
    *   *Why*: Focuses on the "chasing curiosities" aspect.
10. **Rabbit's Wake**
    *   *Why*: We are all just following the Rabbit's chaos.

## Concept Analysis

### Strengths
*   **The Dual Board (Circle vs. Square)**: This is a masterstroke of design. It solves the "crowded board" problem of many tactical games. By keeping players on the rim, the center stage is reserved for the *magic*—the terrain, bosses, and effects. It makes the world feel like a specimen in a jar that players are tapping on.
*   **The "Reaction" Phase**: Having the Square react *after* player manipulation creates a satisfying "set up and watch it go" loop. It emphasizes that players are *meddlers*, not gods. They can influence, but the world has its own momentum.
*   **Theme x State Combinatorics**: The A/B dice system ensures exponential variety. A "Stormy Carnival" plays very differently from a "Prosperous Carnival." This creates a "procedural generation" feel using analog tools.
*   **The Rabbit as "The Snitch"**: In Quidditch, the Snitch is a separate game within the game. Here, the Rabbit serves that purpose—a high-stakes, elusive target that creates moments of pure excitement without ending the session. It validates "lucky" play.
*   **Bosses as "Walking Landscapes"**: Treating bosses as environmental hazards rather than combat encounters fits the "irresponsible magician" fantasy perfectly. You don't fight the storm; you weather it or redirect it at your friend.

### Potential Friction Points (To Watch For)
*   **Analysis Paralysis**: With 64 tiles and multiple relics, "Reach Checks" could become hard to calculate visually. *Solution*: Clear visual rules for adjacency and "line of effect" are crucial.
*   **Relic Clutter**: If relics persist too long, the board might get messy. *Solution*: Theme shifts could "compost" some relics or transform them, as suggested (Ship Marker -> Carousel Token).
*   **Player Interaction**: Ensure "Mischief" spaces on the Circle don't feel too punishing. Stealing resources is fine; negating a whole turn's planning might feel bad. *Solution*: Favors as a defensive currency.

### Identity
The game feels like **"Jumanji meets Talisman meets a procedural roguelike."** It creates a story not through text, but through the collision of systems. The "Irresponsible Magician" persona is the glue—it explains *why* we are doing this: for the thrill, the story, and the shiny charm, not to save the world.
