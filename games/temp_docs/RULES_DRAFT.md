# Core Ruleset Draft (Mechanical Foundation)

## Game Structure
*   **Players**: 2–6
*   **Setup**: Shared two-board setup (Circle & Square).
*   **End Condition**: None. Sessions run for set laps, time, or agreement.
*   **Objective**: Chasing curiosities, collecting stories/charms, not racing to a finish.

## Turn Sequence
1.  **Roll Movement Dice** → Move along the Circle.
2.  **Resolve Landing Space**.
3.  **Optional**: Activate one personal ability (Player Persona).
4.  **Optional**: Spend resources to manipulate the Square.
5.  **Triggered**: Roll Master Die A/B if required (reshapes the Square).
6.  **Environment Reacts**: The Square resolves *one* environmental effect (boats drift, vines grow, etc.).
7.  **Pass Turn**.

> The Square only "reacts" once per turn, *after* player manipulations. Players set up chaos before the world tilts.

## The Circle (Outer Board)
Roughly 28–40 spaces in a loop.

### Space Types (Draft)
*   **Bazaar**: Gain 1 random item.
*   **Workshop**: Convert 2 resources into 1 relic.
*   **Mischief Corner**: Steal 1 resource/relic from another player.
*   **Rabbit Rumor**: Place rumor token; catch rabbit before theme shift = 1 Charm Fragment.
*   **Key Square**: Collective counter; 3 keys = next Boss awakens.
*   **Master Gate A**: Force Master Die A roll (Theme Shift).
*   **Master Gate B**: Force Master Die B roll (State Shift).

## Resources
1.  **Materials**: Fuel. Base currency to interact with Square (move tiles, place obstacles).
2.  **Relics**: Memory. Persistent objects embedded in tiles (bridges, traps, portals).
3.  **Favors**: Social Gravity. Soft currency to tweak odds/rolls.

## The Square (Inner Board)

### Master Dice
