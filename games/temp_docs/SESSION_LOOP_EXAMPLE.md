# Sample Theme-Session Loop

**Setup**:
*   **Players**: 4 (Pyromancer, Thief, Gambler, Beast Whisperer)
*   **Outer Circle**: 32 spaces (Resource, Event, Relic, Rabbit Rumor, Master Gate)
*   **Inner Square**: 8×8 grid
    *   **Theme**: Ocean Leviathans (Water tiles, flooding)
    *   **State**: Storm (Movement penalties, tile drift)
*   **Relics**: Ship Marker, Tide Bell (embedded)
*   **Rabbit Cameo**: Tile D4 (Lifeboat in flooded grid)
*   **Boss**: Kraken (Partially submerged, east edge)

---

## Turn 1: Pyromancer
*   **Roll**: Moves 4 → **Relic Deposit Space**.
*   **Action**: Embeds **Flame Relic** on **B2** (dry rock).
    *   *Intent*: Manipulate tidal flows to block Kraken.
*   **Square Reaction**: Storm shifts tiles; currents move water north.
    *   *Result*: Kraken's path redirected slightly by the current, ignoring the Flame Relic.
*   **Rabbit Check**: Pyromancer is physically on the Circle but "adjacent" to D4 via effect. Uses Flame Relic to create a "safe flare" touching the cameo.
    *   *Result*: **Rabbit Charm Acquired** (2 turns of luck).
*   **End**: Minor flooding spreads.

## Turn 2: Thief
*   **Roll**: Moves 6 → **Rabbit Rumor Space**.
*   **Action**: Receives hint: *"Lifeboat near rising tide, northwest quadrant."*
*   **Square Interaction**: Places **Tide Relic** on **C3**.
    *   *Intent*: Redirect water flow to push the Rabbit Cameo to a reachable tile for next turn.
*   **Boss Interaction**: Kraken moves 1 tile North (Storm pattern), blocking the outer water route.
*   **Rabbit Check**: Fails (Not adjacent).
*   **End**: Gains 1 Material, 1 Favor.

## Turn 3: Gambler
*   **Roll**: Lands on **Master Gate B**.
*   **Action**: Rolls Master Die B → **State Shift: Calm**.
    *   *Effect*: Storm subsides. Ocean tiles stop shifting. Kraken pauses.
*   **Square Interaction**: Uses **Favor Tokens** to move the Tide Bell relic.
    *   *Intent*: Nudge Rabbit closer to another player's line (social manipulation).
*   **Rabbit Check**: Fails. Aura sets up future capture.
*   **End**: Gains minor resources.

## Turn 4: Beast Whisperer
*   **Roll**: Lands on **Resource Space** → Gains **Ship Marker Relic**.
*   **Action**: Uses Ship Marker to transport a Kraken-displacing tile to **E5**.
    *   *Intent*: Create a safe path to D4.
*   **Square Reaction**: Kraken moves 1 tile West, partially blocking D4, but Ship Marker acts as a buffer.
*   **Rabbit Check**: Success via manipulation. **Rabbit Charm Acquired** (2 turns).
*   **End**: Wave ripple opens secondary paths.

## Turn 5: The Shift (Master Die A)
*   **Trigger**: Player triggers **Master Gate A**.
*   **Roll**: Theme Shift → **Electrum Carnival**.
*   **Transformation**:
    *   Water tiles → **Carnival Lights**.
    *   Rabbit Cameo → **Tile F6** (Magician's Hat).
    *   Boss → **Clockwork Ringmaster** (Patterned movement).
    *   Relics Transform:
        *   Ship Marker → **Carousel Token**.
        *   Tide Bell → **Light Orb**.
        *   Flame Relic → **Spark Wand**.
*   **New Puzzle**: The board has fundamentally changed. Previous strategies are void. Players must adapt.

## Key Takeaways
1.  **Indirect Manipulation**: Players never touch the Square physically; they use the Circle to reach in.
2.  **Emergent Story**: The Kraken wasn't killed; it was managed, blocked, and then vanished when reality shifted.
3.  **The Rabbit**: A constant goal in a shifting world.
4.  **Relic Persistence**: Tools adapted to the new reality (Ship Marker -> Carousel Token), keeping player agency alive across shifts.
