# Circle & Square: World Structure & Mechanics

## 1. Macro Layout of the World

The game world consists of two distinct, interacting layers:

### A. The Circle (Outer Board)
*   **Purpose**: The "overworld" interface where players physically move, plan, and gather resources to influence the inner world.
*   **Structure**: A looping path of 28–40 spaces (circular or irregular polygon).
*   **Space Types**:
    *   **Resource Spaces**: Gain Materials, Relics, or Favors.
    *   **Interaction Spaces**: Trade, sabotage, or cooperative actions.
    *   **Master Dice Spaces**: Trigger Theme (Die A) or State (Die B) shifts.
    *   **Rabbit Rumor Spaces**: Reveal hints about the Rabbit Cameo's location.
    *   **Event Spaces**: Minor catastrophes, NPCs, or lore.
    *   **Relic Spaces**: Embed or manipulate relics in the Square.

### B. The Square (Inner Board)
*   **Purpose**: The magical, reactive center where themes unfold, bosses roam, and the Rabbit appears.
*   **Structure**: An 8x8 grid of dynamic tiles.
*   **Tile Components**:
    *   **Terrain Type**: Defined by the current Theme (e.g., Water, Vines, Mirage).
    *   **Contents**: Optional Relic, Boss, or Rabbit Cameo.
    *   **State**: Modifiers (movement cost, hazards) and temporary effects (flooded, burning).
*   **Dynamic Behavior**:
    *   Reacts to **Theme Shifts** (layout changes) and **State Shifts** (behavior/mood changes).
    *   Performs "Center Resolution" after every player turn (e.g., tides rise, statues rotate).

## 2. Themes (Macro Biomes)

Themes define the visual and mechanical rules of the Square. Controlled by **Master Die A**.

| Theme | Core Mechanics | Rabbit Appearance | Boss | Notable Relics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ocean Leviathans** | Water tiles block movement; boats carry relics/players; tides spread. | In a tiny lifeboat. | **Kraken** (Radial movement, attracted to water relics) | Ship Markers, Tide Bells |
| **Electrum Carnival** | Illusion tiles, teleportation, warped movement logic. | Pops from a magician's hat. | **Clockwork Ringmaster** (Shuffles tiles) | Light Orbs, Whistle Relics |
| **Jungle of Thorns** | Vine tiles trap movement; predators; growth spreads. | Peeks from behind vines. | **Thorn Matriarch** (Territorial, grows obstacles) | Vine Whip, Jungle Totem |
| **Velvet Observatory**| Telescope tiles reveal future rolls; constellations buff stats. | Hides behind a star map. | **Starborn Sentinel** (Moves with star alignment) | Cosmic Lens, Chronometer |
| **Glass Desert** | Mirage tiles shift perception; heat damages/drains resources. | Hides under a sand crystal. | **Sand Shard Golem** (Crushes relics) | Crystal Compass, Mirage Lens |

## 3. Master Dice & States

The heartbeat of the world.

*   **Master Die A (Theme)**: Determines *what* the world is (Ocean, Jungle, etc.).
*   **Master Die B (State)**: Determines *how* it behaves.
    *   **Calm**: Standard rules.
    *   **Storm**: Movement penalties, tile drift.
    *   **Prosperity**: Extra resource generation.
    *   **Eclipse**: Rabbit is faint but reachable; hazards increased.
    *   **Awakening**: Dormant relics activate; Bosses more aggressive.
    *   **Invasion**: Boss spawns or enters from edge.

*Example*: **Ocean Leviathans** x **Storm** = Turbulent seas, boats drift randomly, Kraken is agitated.

## 4. Relics (The Memory of Play)

Objects embedded into Square tiles by players from the Circle.

*   **Function**: Persistent tools that modify tile behavior (bridges, traps, lures, blockers).
*   **Strategy**: Used to pathfind to the Rabbit, block Bosses, or mess with opponents.
*   **Persistence**: Can remain across Theme shifts (e.g., a boat from the Ocean theme becomes a grounded wreck in the Desert).

---

## 5. The White Rabbit (The Curiosity)

*   **Role**: The elusive goal. Not a win condition, but a moment of luck and wonder.
*   **Appearance**: Spawns once per Theme Shift in a thematic disguise.
*   **Catching**: Requires a **Reach Check**—creating a chain of adjacency/effect via relics and tile manipulation.
*   **Reward**: **Rabbit Charm** (Temporary Luck).
    *   *Effects*: Choose dice results, mitigate disasters, shop discounts, wrap movement.
    *   *Duration*: Fades after a few turns or next theme shift.

## 6. Bosses (Living Landscapes)

Emergent challenges that walk the board.

*   **Nature**: Not enemies to "defeat" for victory, but obstacles/opportunities to manage.
*   **AI**: Move based on temperament (e.g., attracted to noise, relics, or specific terrain).
*   **Interaction**: Lure, trap, bribe, or weaponize them against others.
*   **Rewards**: Dropped items or changed board states when "defeated" or placated.

---

## 7. Session Ecology

*   **Goal**: No final winner. The joy is in the loop—exploration, manipulation, and "pulling it off."
*   **End**: Defined by lap count, time, or group consensus.
*   **Legacy**: Players leave with stories, spent charms, and potentially relics left on the board for the next session (if persistent).
