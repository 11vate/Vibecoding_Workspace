# Circle & Square: The Living Board

> **Tagline**: Irresponsible magicians chasing curiosities around a living board.

## Core Fantasy
You walk the outer world to shape the inner world, then tempt fate for wonders that don’t last long enough to own—but long enough to remember.

## Foundation
There are two boards married as one experience:

1.  **The Circle (Outer Board)**
    *   The track players travel.
    *   Where you roll dice, gain items, learn tricks, gather resources, trigger Master Dice, and provoke the center.
    *   Contains ~28-40 spaces (Bazaars, Workshops, Gates, etc.).

2.  **The Square (Inner Board)**
    *   The shifting magical heart of the game (8x8 grid).
    *   Changes themes, terrains, hazards, and opportunities throughout play.
    *   Players never stand on these tiles themselves; they manipulate them indirectly.
    *   Driven by **Master Dice** (Theme + State).

## The Goal?
**The game has no final winner.**
It’s about exploration, collection, interaction, and stories. The satisfaction comes from what players *pull off*, not what they finish.

## The Loop of Play
1.  **Roll personal dice** → Move around the Circle.
2.  **Land on a space** → Gain/lose something, trigger effect, interact.
3.  **Outer space effects** → Influence the Square (place obstacles, summon creatures, etc.).
4.  **Board conditions** → Shape next player's options.
5.  **Master Dice** → Trigger theme shifts, catastrophes, bosses, or rare opportunities.
6.  **Rabbit Cameo** → A white rabbit appears in a new disguise when themes shift. Catching it grants temporary luck.

## Why The Game Persists
There’s no "final winner" because the game isn’t about closure—it’s about returning to see what changed.
*   Each session reshapes the Square.
*   New combinations of Theme + State yield new geometry.
*   Persistent relics embedded in tiles echo into future sessions.
*   Nobody "wins" the rabbit—people just get lucky enough to meet it sometimes.

## The Feel
Players laugh, argue, negotiate, manipulate symbols of power they barely understand, and occasionally somebody brushes past that white rabbit, pockets luck for a moment, and everything tilts their way just long enough to feel magical.
