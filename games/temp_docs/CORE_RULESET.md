# Circle & Square: Core Ruleset (Draft)

## Game Structure
*   **Players**: 2–6 (Irresponsible Magicians)
*   **Components**:
    *   **The Circle**: Outer board (Movement & Planning).
    *   **The Square**: Inner 8x8 grid (The Living World).
    *   **Master Dice**: Die A (Theme) & Die B (State).
    *   **Player Dice**: Personal movement dice.
*   **Objective**: Explore, collect, manipulate the world, catch the Rabbit, and create stories. No final "win state."

## Turn Structure (Per Player)

1.  **Roll Movement Dice**: Move token along the Circle.
2.  **Resolve Space**: Activate the effect of the landing space (Gain resources, Trade, Event, etc.).
3.  **Optional Actions**:
    *   **Cast Spell**: Use a personal ability (Persona-specific).
    *   **Manipulate Square**: Spend **Materials** to influence tiles (rotate, shift, place obstacle).
    *   **Embed Relic**: Spend **Relics** to place a persistent object on a valid Square tile.
4.  **Trigger Master Dice** (If landed on Gate/Event):
    *   Roll Die A (Theme) or Die B (State) if required.
    *   Resolve immediate world shifts.
5.  **Square Reaction**: The world breathes.
    *   Resolve environmental effects (e.g., tide spreads, vines grow).
    *   Bosses move/act.
6.  **Pass Turn**.

*Key Nuance*: The Square reacts *after* player manipulation, allowing players to set up "traps" or paths before the world moves.

## Resources

*   **Materials**: Fuel for direct manipulation (shifting tiles, clearing hazards).
*   **Relics**: Persistent items embedded in the Square (Bridges, Lures, Traps).
*   **Favors**: Social/Luck currency. Used to tweak dice rolls or "bribe" the game logic for Reach Checks.

## The Rabbit Hunt

1.  **Appearance**: The Rabbit appears on a random tile when the Theme shifts.
2.  **The Catch**: A player must establish **Line of Effect** or **Adjacency** to the Rabbit's tile using their tools (Relics, Spells, Tile manipulation). You cannot simply "walk" to it on the Square (players are on the Circle).
3.  **Reward**: **Rabbit Charm** – A temporary buff that breaks game rules in the player's favor.

## Bosses

*   Spawn based on State (e.g., "Invasion") or specific board conditions.
*   Act as mobile hazards or resource piñatas.
*   Can be manipulated to block other players or destroy unwanted tiles.

## End of Session

*   The game ends when the agreed limit is reached (Time, Laps, or Theme Shifts).
*   Players recount their "best trick" or "closest call."
*   (Optional) One relic per player remains on the board for the next game.
