# Summoning System & Economy: The Core Uplink & The Black Market

## Overview
The summoning system has been completely overhauled to align with the "Retro-Future Glitch" aesthetic. It is no longer a simple shop. It is split into two distinct channels: **The Core Uplink** (Authorized Gacha) and **The Black Market** (Unauthorized/Glitch Shop).

## 1. The Core Uplink (Gacha System)
*Theme: "Authorized Access to The Grid's Genetic Database"*

Players connect to The Core to download (summon) new Prime Pets. This is a randomized process representing the extraction of data from the noisy depths of the network.

### Currencies
*   **Data Keys**: The primary summoning currency. Earned through gameplay, dailies, or events.
*   **System Essence**: A pity currency earned with every summon. Can be exchanged for specific rotation pets.

### Banners (Pools)
1.  **Standard Uplink**: Contains all non-limited Prime Pets.
2.  **Focus Signal (Rotational)**: Higher rates for specific Families (e.g., "Week of the Pyro-Kin").
3.  **Anomaly Event**: Limited-time banners for new or seasonal pets.

### Drop Rates (Base)
*   **Mythic (Tier 5)**: 0.5%
*   **Legendary (Tier 4)**: 3.0%
*   **SR (Tier 3)**: 15.0%
*   **Rare (Tier 2)**: 35.0%
*   **Basic (Tier 1)**: 46.5%

### Mechanics
*   **Pity System**:
    *   *Soft Pity*: Rate increases after 50 summons without a Legendary+.
    *   *Hard Pity*: Guaranteed Legendary/Mythic at 80 summons.
*   **Duplicate Protection**: If you pull a Base Pet you already own, it is automatically converted into **Pet Shards** (used for Limit Breaking) and **System Essence**.

## 2. The Black Market (The Glitch Shop)
*Theme: "Unauthorized Access. Connection Unsecured."*

A hidden, unstable marketplace run by a rogue AI entity. Here, players can buy specific items and "Hacked Pets" using illicit currency.

### Currency
*   **Corrupted Bytes**: Earned by:
    *   Releasing "Glitched" pets.
    *   Winning battles in "Chaos Domains".
    *   Recycling Chaos Stones.

### Inventory (Rotating Daily)
1.  **Hacked Pets**: Base pets that come pre-glitched (e.g., "Unstable Pyroclast"). They have:
    *   Higher base stats (+10%).
    *   High risk of "Code Decay" (lower max HP or random debuffs).
    *   Exclusive "Hacked" visual tag.
2.  **Glitched Stones**: Tier IV/V Chaos Stones (Opal).
3.  **Forbidden Modules**: Items that force specific outcomes in fusion (e.g., "Force Glitch Drive").

### The "Gamble" Feature
Players can pay a small amount of Corrupted Bytes to "Refresh" the market, but doing so too many times increases the "Detection Risk" (prices go up).

## 3. User Interface Concepts

### The Core Uplink UI
*   **Visuals**: Clean, blue/white holographic interface. Stable scanlines.
*   **Animation**: A data stream downloads rapidly. The screen flashes the color of the rarity (Gold for Legendary, Rainbow for Mythic).
*   **Sound**: High-tech server hums, "Access Granted" chimes.

### The Black Market UI
*   **Visuals**: Dark, red/purple hues. Heavy chromatic aberration. Text sometimes flickers or changes characters (e.g., "SHOP" -> "$H0P").
*   **Animation**: The screen "tears" open to reveal the shop. Items look like they are vibrating.
*   **Sound**: Static noise, distorted whispers, heavy bass throbs.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
*   **Phase 1**: Implement the Gacha logic (Weighted RNG).
*   **Phase 2**: Build the Black Market inventory rotation system.
*   **Phase 3**: Create the visual distinctness (The "Clean" vs. "Glitch" UI themes).
