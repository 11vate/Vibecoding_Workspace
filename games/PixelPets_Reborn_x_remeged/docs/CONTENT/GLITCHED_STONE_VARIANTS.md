# Glitched Stone Variants & Enhanced Mutation Effects

## Overview
This document details the design of glitched stone variants in Pixel Pets Reborn X Remerged. Glitched stones are special variants of existing stones that have been corrupted by chaos energy, creating enhanced mutation effects during fusion and unique properties that increase the probability and power of glitched fusion outcomes.

## Glitched Stone Formation & Origin

### Chaos Corruption Process
Glitched stones form when standard stones are exposed to concentrated chaos energy from The Grid's corrupted sectors. This exposure corrupts the stone's data structure, causing it to exhibit unpredictable properties while amplifying its base effects.

### Location of Formation
- **Chaos Zones**: Areas of The Grid where reality is unstable
- **Corrupted Sectors**: Data structures that have been damaged by errors
- **Glitch Wells**: Pools of concentrated chaotic data
- **Anomaly Fields**: Regions where normal rules don't apply

### Rarity of Glitched Stones
- **Glitched Common Stones**: 5% chance of standard stones becoming glitched
- **Glitched Rare Stones**: 8% chance of rare stones becoming glitched
- **Glitched Epic Stones**: 12% chance of epic stones becoming glitched
- **Glitched Legendary Stones**: 15% chance of legendary stones becoming glitched
- **Glitched Mythic Stones**: 20% chance of mythic stones becoming glitched

## Core Glitched Stone Properties

### Universal Glitched Properties
All glitched stones share the following base properties:
- **Mutation Amplification**: Increases mutation chance by 50%
- **Chaos Resonance**: Doubles the base 3-7% glitch chance (6-14%)
