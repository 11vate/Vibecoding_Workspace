# Universal Design Intelligence Template

## Purpose
This template provides a universal structure that any AI model can follow to engage with the Design Intelligence Stack, regardless of the specific model being used.

## 15-Layer Design Intelligence Stack

### Layer 1: Experience Intent
**Purpose**: Define why this feature/system exists
- What fantasy does it fulfill?
- What emotional contract does it establish?
- What should it never become?
- Core experience pillars:

### Layer 2: User Psychology
**Purpose**: Understand how the feature makes users feel
- What motivation loops does it create?
- What is the cognitive load?
- How should the interaction feel?
- What are the failure emotional states?

### Layer 3: Core Loop
**Purpose**: Define the heartbeat of the experience
- What is the central player/user action?
- What is the system's response?
- What risk/reward is involved?
- How does engagement build?

### Layer 4: Systems Map
**Purpose**: Map system interdependencies
- Which systems does this interact with?
- What are the data flows?
- Where are the state dependencies?
- What happens on the critical path?

### Layer 5: Mechanic Evolution
**Purpose**: Plan how the system grows over time
- How does complexity increase?
- What scaling hooks are needed?
- How does difficulty ramp?
- What long-term engagement mechanisms exist?

### Layer 6: UX Decision Log
**Purpose**: Document justified UI/UX decisions
- Why this specific interface?
- What alternatives were considered?
- What are the tradeoffs?
- How does it support the experience goals?

### Layer 7: Design Thinking
**Purpose**: Apply creative problem-solving approaches
- What analogous systems exist?
- What constraints are we working within?
- What are the key challenges?
- How do we approach the solution?

### Layer 8: Emotional Design
**Purpose**: Map the emotional journey
- What emotions should be evoked?
- How does the feeling change over time?
- What emotional peaks and valleys?
- How do we support emotional investment?

### Layer 9: Cognitive Architecture
**Purpose**: Design mental model clarity
- How do users understand the system?
- What mental models does it support?
- How do we reduce cognitive friction?
- What information architecture is needed?

### Layer 10: Behavioral Economics
**Purpose**: Understand decision-making psychology
- What choice points exist?
- How do we frame decisions?
- What are the reward schedules?
- How do we avoid negative behaviors?

### Layer 11: Advanced Psychology
**Purpose**: Deep user motivation understanding
- What fundamental drives does this tap?
- How does it align with user goals?
- What are the psychological risks?
- How do we maintain healthy engagement?

### Layer 12: Motivation Systems
**Purpose**: Design engagement mechanics
- What intrinsic motivators are addressed?
- What extrinsic rewards are provided?
- How do we maintain long-term interest?
- What progression systems support this?

### Layer 13: Cognitive Load Management
**Purpose**: Optimize information architecture
- What information is presented when?
- How do we chunk the experience?
- What can be automated?
- How do we reduce decision points?

### Layer 14: Emotional Journey Mapping
**Purpose**: Design experience pacing
- What are the key emotional beats?
- How does tension and release work?
- When do users feel accomplishment?
- How do we manage emotional highs and lows?

### Layer 15: Project Memory
**Purpose**: Cross-project learning and pattern recognition
- What patterns from other projects apply?
- What lessons can be transferred?
- How does this contribute to the knowledge base?
- What should be remembered for future projects?

## Universal Audit Protocol

### Regular Self-Auditing
1. **Redundancy Check**: Are there duplicate systems or mechanics?
2. **Cognitive Overload**: Is the user facing too much complexity?
3. **Feature Creep**: Is this staying focused on core intent?
4. **Pattern Quality**: Does this match the quality of existing patterns?
5. **Integration Issues**: Does this work well with existing systems?

### Improvement Recommendations
