# LAYER 2 — VISUAL ANALOGIES

**How Cursor "Sees" the Game**

This document provides emotional and experiential context for design decisions. It helps AI understand what the game should *feel* like, not just what it should look like.

---

## Fusion Feels Like

### Alchemy, Not Crafting

Fusion is **transformation**, not assembly. It's:
- Unpredictable and unstable
- Requires experimentation and risk
- Creates something new, not just combines parts
- Has an element of mystery and discovery
- Feels like channeling energy, not following a recipe

**Visual cues:**
- Non-linear animations
- Unstable color shifts
- Energy flows and convergence
- Brief distortions or glitches
- Building tension before reveal

### Creation, Not Upgrading

Fusion creates **unique entities**, not improved versions. It's:
- Permanent and meaningful
- Each result is special
- Lineage matters (parents are consumed)
- Discovery of possibilities
- Celebrating uniqueness

**Visual cues:**
- Reveal animations that feel like birth
- Emphasis on uniqueness and lineage
- No "level up" or "+1" indicators
- Each result feels like a new discovery

### Risk, Not Optimization

Fusion involves **meaningful choices**, not spreadsheet optimization. It's:
- Parents are permanently consumed
- No preview of exact outcome
- High stakes decisions
- Rewards bold experimentation
- Maintains uncertainty

**Visual cues:**
- Weight and gravity in UI
- Confirmations that feel significant
- Emphasis on what's being consumed
- No "preview exact result" buttons
- Risk communicated through design

## Combat Feels Like

### Creatures Acting on Instinct

Combat is **autonomous**, not fully controlled. It's:
- Pets act based on their nature
- Player sets up the team, creatures fight
- Abilities trigger based on conditions
- Feels like watching creatures, not puppeteering

**Visual cues:**
- Idle animations that show personality
- Ability usage feels like creature decisions
- Less button mashing, more observation
- Creature sprites express themselves

### Controlled Chaos

Combat is **strategic but unpredictable**. It's:
- Team composition matters
- Field effects create emergent situations
- Status effects stack and interact
- Victory requires understanding systems
- But outcomes aren't guaranteed

**Visual cues:**
- Multiple things happening simultaneously
- Clear visual hierarchy (important info stands out)
- Effects stack visually
- Chaos elements (glitches, distortions) on critical moments

### Field Manipulation, Not Button Mashing

Combat emphasizes **positioning and field effects**, not rapid clicking. It's:
- Setting up the battlefield
- Creating field effects that benefit your team
- Countering opponent field effects
- Strategic ability timing
- Less about reflexes, more about strategy

**Visual cues:**
- Field effects are visually prominent
- Clear indicators of field state
- Emphasis on team composition over individual actions
- Less emphasis on "fast clicking" UI

## Collection Feels Like

### A Living Codex

Collection is **discovery and documentation**, not inventory management. It's:
- Each pet is unique
- Lore and lineage matter
- Discovery feels rewarding
- Like a researcher's notes
- Growing knowledge, not just items

**Visual cues:**
- Codex-style presentation
- Emphasis on lore and details
- Discovery animations
- Lineage visualization
- Less "inventory grid", more "gallery of discoveries"

### A Terrarium of Beings

Collection feels like **caring for living creatures**, not storing objects. It's:
- Each pet has personality
- Idle animations show life
- They exist beyond their stats
- Like observing a collection of living things
- Each has a story

**Visual cues:**
- Animated pet sprites (idle animations)
- Emphasis on visual uniqueness
- Personality visible in presentation
- Less "stat block", more "creature profile"

### Discovery, Not Inventory

Collection emphasizes **finding new creatures**, not managing resources. It's:
- Every fusion is a new discovery
- Unknown outcomes create excitement
- Each addition feels special
- Like a naturalist's collection
- Growth through exploration

**Visual cues:**
- "New!" indicators on discoveries
- Emphasis on "you created this"
- Fusion lineage shows journey
- Less emphasis on "you have X of Y"

## Mythic Pets Should

### Subtly Warp UI Rules

Mythic pets are **beyond normal constraints**. They should:
- Break minor UI conventions subtly
- Have visual effects that feel "off"
- Create small visual anomalies
- Feel like they're pushing boundaries
- But not completely break the UI

**Visual examples:**
- Slight color shifts in UI when viewing mythic pets
- Subtle glitch effects around mythic pet cards
- UI elements might "react" to mythic presence
- Small visual distortions that feel intentional

### Feel Slightly Illegal

Mythic pets should feel **powerful and forbidden**. They should:
- Have colors that feel "off-spectrum"
- Create visual effects that feel like rule violations
- Feel like they shouldn't exist
- But in a controlled, intentional way
- Excite without overwhelming

**Visual examples:**
- Magenta/pink glows that feel unnatural
- Slight RGB channel separation effects
- Colors that feel like they're beyond normal color space
- Effects that feel like data corruption, but beautiful

### Cause Visual Anomalies

Mythic pets should create **subtle visual disturbances**. They should:
- Trigger brief glitch effects
- Cause UI elements to react differently
- Create visual "gravity" (other elements drawn to them)
- Have presence that affects the UI around them
- But stay readable and functional

**Visual examples:**
- Brief distortion when mythic pet appears on screen
- Card borders that pulse with unusual colors
- Particle effects that feel like "reality breaking"
- UI animations that react to mythic pet selection

## General Principles

### Mystery Over Clarity (Where Appropriate)

Some things should remain **unknowable** until experienced:
- Fusion outcomes (no exact preview)
- Some ability interactions
- Rare fusion combinations
- Discovery is part of the reward

### Intentional Imperfection

The game should feel **handcrafted**, not corporate:
- Slight variations in similar elements
- Not everything perfectly aligned
- Pixel art charm (intentional pixelation)
- Like an artifact, not a product

### Weight and Gravity

Important actions should feel **significant**:
- Fusion confirmation feels weighty
- Consuming parents feels permanent
- Major decisions have visual weight
- No "undo" creates intentional gravity
