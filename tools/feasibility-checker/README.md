# Feasibility Checker Tool

## Purpose

Automated tool for checking technical feasibility, validating designs against constraints and capabilities.

**Automated checking ensures feasibility before implementation.**

---

## How It Works

### Check Process

**Process**:
1. Analyze design requirements
2. Check against constraints
3. Evaluate technologies
4. Assess performance
5. Generate feasibility report

**Output**: Feasibility report with recommendations

---

### Check Criteria

**What to Check**:
- Framework constraints
- Browser capabilities
- PWA requirements
- Offline capability
- Performance targets
- Architecture feasibility

**Why**: Multiple criteria ensure comprehensive checking.

---

## Usage

### When to Use

**Use feasibility checker when**:
- Designing new systems
- Adding major features
- Changing architecture
- Facing constraints

**Why**: Early checking prevents problems.

---

### How to Use

**Usage process**:
1. Provide design requirements
2. Run feasibility checker
3. Review feasibility report
4. Address issues
5. Re-check if needed

**Why**: Systematic usage ensures feasibility.
