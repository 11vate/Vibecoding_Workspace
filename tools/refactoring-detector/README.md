# Refactoring Detector Tool

## Purpose

Automated tool for detecting refactoring needs, identifying code smells and improvement opportunities.

**Automated detection enables proactive refactoring.**

---

## Detection Process

### Step 1: Code Analysis

**What to Analyze**:
- Code structure
- Complexity metrics
- Dependencies
- Patterns

**Output**: Code analysis results

---

### Step 2: Trigger Detection

**What to Detect**:
- Code smells
- Architecture issues
- Performance problems
- Maintainability issues

**Output**: Trigger detection results

---

### Step 3: Refactoring Suggestions

**What to Suggest**:
- Refactoring opportunities
- Pattern applications
- Improvement strategies
- Priority recommendations

**Output**: Refactoring suggestions

---

## Detection Criteria

### Code Smell Detection

**What to Detect**:
- Duplication
- Complexity
- Poor naming
- Long functions

**Why**: Code smells indicate problems.

---

### Architecture Detection

**What to Detect**:
- Tight coupling
- Circular dependencies
- Poor modularity
- Architecture drift

**Why**: Architecture problems cause issues.

---

## Usage

### When to Detect

**Detect when**:
- Code is written
- Code is reviewed
- Before refactoring
- During maintenance

**Why**: Regular detection maintains quality.

---

### How to Use

**Usage process**:
1. Provide code
2. Run detector
3. Review suggestions
4. Plan refactoring
5. Execute refactoring

**Why**: Systematic usage enables improvement.
