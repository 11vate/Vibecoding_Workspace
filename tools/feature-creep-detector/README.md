# Feature Creep Detector Tool

## Purpose

Automated tool for detecting feature creep, enabling focus maintenance.

**Feature creep detection maintains focus.**

---

## Detection Process

### Step 1: Analyze Features

**What to Analyze**:
- Feature count
- Feature purpose
- Feature usage
- Feature alignment

**Output**: Feature analysis

---

### Step 2: Identify Creep

**What to Identify**:
- Non-core features
- Unused features
- Misaligned features
- Scope expansion

**Output**: Creep identification

---

### Step 3: Recommend Focus

**What to Recommend**:
- Core feature focus
- Removal candidates
- Scope reduction
- Focus restoration

**Output**: Focus recommendations

---

## Detection Criteria

### Scope Creep

**What to Detect**:
- Scope expansion
- Feature accumulation
- Goal drift
- Focus loss

**Why**: Scope creep dilutes focus.

---

### Feature Accumulation

**What to Detect**:
- Feature multiplication
- Unused features
- Redundant features
- Misaligned features

**Why**: Feature accumulation increases complexity.

---

## Usage

### When to Detect

**Detect when**:
- Features accumulate
- Scope expands
- Focus drifts
- Complexity increases

**Why**: Detection maintains focus.

---

### How to Use

**Usage process**:
1. Provide feature list
2. Run detector
3. Review creep report
4. Restore focus
5. Re-check if needed

**Why**: Systematic usage maintains focus.

## Integration Points

### Self-Auditing
- Detector supports auditing
- Auditing uses detector
- Detector enables auditing

### Knowledge Base
- Creep patterns documented
- Patterns guide detection
- Detection accumulates knowledge

---

**This tool enables automated feature creep detection, maintaining focus and preventing bloat.**
