## How to Use This Library

### When Designing Systems

1. **Search for similar games**
2. **Review what they do well**
3. **Learn from their mistakes**
4. **Adapt patterns, don't copy**

### When Evaluating Ideas

1. **Compare to reference games**
2. **Consider what works/doesn't work**
3. **Learn from failures**
4. **Adapt successful patterns**

### When Adding New Entries

1. **Follow entry format**
2. **Be specific about strengths/weaknesses**
3. **Note what can be adapted**
4. **Include relevant observations**

---

**This library enables Cursor to learn from successful games while avoiding their mistakes, adapting patterns rather than copying them.**
