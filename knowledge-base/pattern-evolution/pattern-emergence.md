# Pattern Emergence Library

## Purpose

This library documents patterns that emerge from system interactions, enabling Cursor to design for emergence.

**Emergent patterns create unexpected value. Understanding emergence enables better design.**

## Emergence Types

### Interaction Emergence

**Patterns emerging from system interactions**:
- System interactions
- Component interactions
- User-system interactions

---

### Evolution Emergence

**Patterns emerging over time**:
- Pattern evolution
- System evolution
- User behavior evolution

---

### Combination Emergence

**Patterns emerging from combinations**:
- Pattern combinations
- System combinations
- Feature combinations

---

## Emergence Design

### Designing for Emergence

**How to design for emergence**:
- Enable system interactions
- Allow pattern combinations
- Support evolution
- Monitor for emergence

**Why**: Emergence creates unexpected value.

---

### Controlling Emergence

**How to control emergence**:
- Set boundaries
- Guide interactions
- Monitor outcomes
- Adjust systems

**Why**: Emergence must be controlled.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Design for Emergence

**Design for emergence when**:
- Systems interact
- Patterns combine
- Evolution possible
- Value from emergence

**Why**: Emergence can create value.

---

### How to Harness Emergence

**Harnessing process**:
1. Enable interactions
2. Monitor for emergence
3. Identify valuable emergence
4. Support valuable emergence
5. Control negative emergence

**Why**: Harness emergence for value.
