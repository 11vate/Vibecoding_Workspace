# Pattern Combinations Library

## Purpose

This library documents successful pattern combinations, enabling Cursor to understand how patterns work together.

**Patterns combine. Understanding combinations enables better design.**

**Description**: [What the combination does]

**Why It Works**:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**Interaction**:
- [How patterns interact]
- [Synergies]
- [Conflicts]

**When to Use**:
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

**Examples**:
- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]

**Related Combinations**: [Links to related combinations]

## Combination Types

### Complementary

**Patterns that enhance each other**:
- Synergistic effects
- Mutual reinforcement
- Complementary strengths

---

### Sequential

**Patterns used in sequence**:
- Pattern chains
- Progressive patterns
- Sequential flows

---

### Parallel

**Patterns used simultaneously**:
- Concurrent patterns
- Parallel systems
- Simultaneous effects

---

## Combination Analysis

### Synergies

**How patterns enhance each other**:
- Mutual benefits
- Reinforcing effects
- Complementary strengths

**Why**: Synergies create value.

---

### Conflicts

**How patterns conflict**:
- Competing goals
- Resource conflicts
- Interaction problems

**Why**: Conflicts must be resolved.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Combine

**Combine patterns when**:
- Single pattern insufficient
- Patterns complement each other
- Combination creates value
- Synergies exist

**Why**: Combinations enable complex designs.

---

### How to Combine

**Combination process**:
1. Understand individual patterns
2. Assess compatibility
3. Identify synergies and conflicts
4. Design combination
5. Test combination

**Why**: Careful combination prevents conflicts.
