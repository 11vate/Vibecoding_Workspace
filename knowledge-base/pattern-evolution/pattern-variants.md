# Pattern Variants Library

## Purpose

This library documents variations of patterns, enabling Cursor to understand pattern flexibility and choose appropriate variants.

**Patterns have variants. Understanding variants enables better adaptation.**

---

## Variant Entry Format

```markdown
## [Pattern Name] - [Variant Name]

**Base Pattern**: [Link to base pattern]
**Variant Type**: [Modification/Extension/Simplification]

**Description**: [How this variant differs]

**Modifications**:
- [Modification 1]
- [Modification 2]

**When to Use**:
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Gains**: [What you gain]
- **Loses**: [What you lose]

**Examples**:
- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]
```

## Variant Types

### Modifications

**Patterns modified for specific contexts**:
- Context-specific changes
- Constraint adaptations
- Performance optimizations

---

### Extensions

**Patterns extended with additional features**:
- Feature additions
- Complexity increases
- Capability expansions

---

### Simplifications

**Patterns simplified for specific needs**:
- Feature reductions
- Complexity decreases
- Minimal implementations

---

## Variant Relationships

### Variant Tree

**Structure**:
```
Base Pattern
├── Variant 1
│   ├── Sub-variant 1.1
│   └── Sub-variant 1.2
└── Variant 2
    └── Sub-variant 2.1
```

**Why**: Variants form trees. Understand relationships.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Variants

**Use variants when**:
- Base pattern doesn't fit exactly
- Context requires modification
- Constraints require adaptation
- Performance requires optimization

**Why**: Variants enable pattern adaptation.

---

### How to Choose Variants

**Selection process**:
1. Understand base pattern
2. Assess variant differences
3. Evaluate tradeoffs
4. Choose appropriate variant
5. Adapt as needed

**Why**: Choose variants that fit context.

---
