# Cross-Project Insights

## Purpose

This document accumulates insights discovered across multiple projects, enabling Cursor to apply learnings from one project to another.

**Cross-project insights enable knowledge transfer.**

## Insight Entry Format

```markdown
## [Insight Title]

**Projects**: [List of projects where insight was discovered]
**Category**: [Design/Technical/UX/etc.]

**Insight**: [What was learned]

**Evidence**:
- [Project 1]: [Evidence]
- [Project 2]: [Evidence]

**Application**:
- [How to apply]
- [When to apply]

**Limitations**:
- [When it doesn't apply]
- [Constraints]

**Related Insights**: [Links to related insights]
```

## Insight Categories

### Design Insights

**Design learnings across projects**:
- What works in design
- What doesn't work
- Design patterns
- Design principles

---

### Technical Insights

**Technical learnings across projects**:
- Architecture patterns
- Performance optimizations
- Implementation strategies
- Technical constraints

---

### UX Insights

**UX learnings across projects**:
- User behavior patterns
- Interaction patterns
- Cognitive load management
- Emotional design

---

## Insight Discovery

### Pattern Recognition

**How insights are discovered**:
- Identify recurring patterns
- Analyze across projects
- Extract principles
- Validate insights

**Why**: Patterns reveal insights.

---

### Validation

**How insights are validated**:
- Multiple project evidence
- User testing
- Outcome analysis
- Success metrics

**Why**: Validation ensures insights are reliable.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference

**Reference insights when**:
- Starting new projects
- Solving similar problems
- Looking for proven approaches
- Avoiding known pitfalls

**Why**: Apply learnings across projects.

---

### How to Apply

**Application process**:
1. Understand insight
2. Assess applicability
3. Adapt to context
4. Test application
5. Document results

**Why**: Insights must be adapted to context.
