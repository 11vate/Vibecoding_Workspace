# Failed Patterns Library

## Purpose

This library accumulates patterns that have failed, enabling Cursor to avoid repeating mistakes.

**Learning from failures prevents repeating them.**

## Failure Categories

### Design Failures

**Patterns that failed due to design issues**:
- Poor user experience
- Confusing interfaces
- Misaligned mental models
- Cognitive overload

---

### Technical Failures

**Patterns that failed due to technical issues**:
- Performance problems
- Scalability issues
- Architecture problems
- Implementation difficulties

---

### Engagement Failures

**Patterns that failed due to engagement issues**:
- Low retention
- Poor progression
- Weak motivation
- Boring experiences

---

## Failure Analysis

### Root Causes

**Common root causes**:
- Assumptions about users
- Ignoring constraints
- Over-engineering
- Under-testing
- Poor adaptation

**Why**: Understanding root causes prevents repetition.

---

### Prevention Strategies

**How to prevent**:
- Validate assumptions
- Respect constraints
- Keep it simple
- Test thoroughly
- Adapt carefully

**Why**: Prevention is better than failure.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference

**Reference failed patterns when**:
- Considering similar approaches
- Evaluating design options
- Learning from mistakes
- Avoiding known failures

**Why**: Avoid repeating failures.

---

### How to Learn

**Learning Process**:
1. Understand why it failed
2. Identify root causes
3. Extract lessons
4. Apply prevention strategies
5. Consider alternatives

**Why**: Learn from failures to avoid them.
