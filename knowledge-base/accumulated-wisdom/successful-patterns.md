# Successful Patterns Library

## Purpose

This library accumulates successful patterns discovered across projects, enabling Cursor to reuse proven solutions.

**Patterns here have been validated through successful implementation.**

## Pattern Categories

### Mechanics Patterns

**Collection**: Patterns for game/app mechanics that have proven successful.

**Examples**:
- Fusion mechanics
- Progression systems
- Reward schedules
- Challenge curves

---

### UX Patterns

**Collection**: Patterns for user interfaces that have proven successful.

**Examples**:
- Navigation patterns
- Feedback patterns
- Loading states
- Error handling

---

### System Patterns

**Collection**: Patterns for system architecture that have proven successful.

**Examples**:
- State management
- Event systems
- Asset management
- Data persistence

---

## Pattern Validation

### Success Criteria

**Patterns are added when**:
- ✅ Used successfully in at least 2 projects
- ✅ Validated through user testing
- ✅ Documented with examples
- ✅ Proven effective

**Why**: Only validated patterns are added.

---

## Pattern Evolution

### Version Tracking

**What to Track**:
- Pattern variations discovered
- Success rate changes
- Usage across projects
- Improvements made

**Why**: Patterns evolve. Track evolution.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference

**Reference successful patterns when**:
- Designing new features
- Solving similar problems
- Looking for proven solutions
- Avoiding reinvention

**Why**: Reuse proven solutions.

---

### How to Adapt

**Adaptation Process**:
1. Understand pattern structure
2. Identify required modifications
3. Assess adaptation risks
4. Test adapted pattern
5. Document adaptation

**Why**: Patterns must be adapted, not copied.

---

## Integration Points

### Design Intelligence
- Inform system design
- Guide UX decisions
- Influence mechanic design

### Knowledge Base
- Cross-reference with pattern libraries
- Link to related patterns
- Connect to failure patterns
