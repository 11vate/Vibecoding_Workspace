# Anti-Patterns Library

## Purpose

Comprehensive library of design and implementation anti-patterns, enabling Cursor to recognize and avoid common mistakes.

**Recognizing anti-patterns prevents mistakes. This library enables prevention.**

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Feature Creep

**Description**: Adding features that don't serve core experience.

**Why It's Bad**: Dilutes focus, increases complexity, breaks experience.

**Prevention**: Maintain clear vision, say no, regular audits.

---

### Over-Engineering

**Description**: Building more than needed.

**Why It's Bad**: Unnecessary complexity, harder to understand, slower development.

**Prevention**: Build what's needed, accept "good enough", simplify.

---

### Cognitive Overload

**Description**: Too much information/choices for users.

**Why It's Bad**: Overwhelms users, causes confusion, reduces usability.

**Prevention**: Progressive disclosure, limit choices, organize information.

---

### Magic Numbers

**Description**: Hard-coded numbers without meaning.

**Why It's Bad**: Hard to understand, hard to change, error-prone.

**Prevention**: Use named constants, document values, make tunable.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference

**Reference when**:
- Designing systems
- Auditing projects
- Preventing mistakes
- Learning from failures

**Why**: Reference prevents anti-patterns.

---

### How to Use

**Usage process**:
1. Recognize anti-pattern
2. Understand why it's bad
3. Apply prevention
4. Fix if present
5. Document learning

**Why**: Systematic usage prevents anti-patterns.

---

## Integration Points

### Failure Analysis
- Anti-patterns map to failures
- Failures reveal anti-patterns
- Anti-patterns prevent failures

### Knowledge Base
- Adds to accumulated wisdom
- Tracks anti-pattern occurrences
- Shares anti-pattern knowledge

---

**This library enables Cursor to recognize and avoid common anti-patterns, preventing mistakes and ensuring quality.**
