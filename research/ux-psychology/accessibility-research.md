## Accessibility Principles

### Perceivable

**Principle**: Information must be perceivable to all users.

**Requirements**:
- Text alternatives for images
- Captions for audio
- Sufficient color contrast
- Resizable text

**Design Implications**:
- Provide text alternatives
- Include captions
- Ensure contrast
- Support text resizing

**Why**: Perceivability enables access.

---

### Operable

**Principle**: Interface must be operable by all users.

**Requirements**:
- Keyboard accessible
- No seizure triggers
- Enough time
- Navigable

**Design Implications**:
- Support keyboard navigation
- Avoid flashing
- Provide time controls
- Enable navigation

**Why**: Operability enables use.

---

### Understandable

**Principle**: Interface must be understandable to all users.

**Requirements**:
- Readable text
- Predictable functionality
- Input assistance

**Design Implications**:
- Use clear language
- Maintain consistency
- Provide help
- Assist input

**Why**: Understandability enables comprehension.

---

### Robust

**Principle**: Interface must work with assistive technologies.

**Requirements**:
- Valid markup
- ARIA support
- Screen reader compatible
- Assistive technology support

**Design Implications**:
- Use valid markup
- Include ARIA
- Test with screen readers
- Support assistive technologies

**Why**: Robustness enables assistive technology use.
