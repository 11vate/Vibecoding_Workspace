# Cognitive Models Research

## Purpose

Research on cognitive models relevant to UX design, grounding design decisions in how users actually think.

**This research grounds UX in cognitive science.**

---

## Key Cognitive Models

### Working Memory Model

**Model**: Users can hold 7±2 items in working memory.

**Design Implications**:
- Limit choices to 5-7 options
- Chunk information
- Use progressive disclosure
- Support memory with visual aids

**Why**: Respecting working memory limits prevents overload.

---

### Mental Model Theory

**Model**: Users build mental models of how systems work.

**Design Implications**:
- Align with user mental models
- Use familiar patterns
- Provide clear feedback
- Support model building

**Why**: Aligned mental models enable effective use.

---

### Information Processing Model

**Model**: Users process information through stages (perception, attention, memory).

**Design Implications**:
- Make information perceptible
- Guide attention
- Support memory
- Reduce processing load

**Why**: Understanding processing enables better design.

---

### Cognitive Load Theory

**Model**: Three types of cognitive load (intrinsic, extraneous, germane).

**Design Implications**:
- Minimize extraneous load
- Manage intrinsic load
- Support germane load
- Reduce total load

**Why**: Managing cognitive load prevents overload.

## Research Sources

### Academic Research

**Sources**:
- Cognitive psychology papers
- Human-computer interaction research
- Information processing studies
- Memory research

**Why**: Academic research provides evidence-based insights.

---

### Industry Research

**Sources**:
- UX research reports
- Usability studies
- Industry best practices
- Case studies

**Why**: Industry research provides practical insights.

## Design Applications

### Interface Design

**How to Apply**:
- Limit information density
- Organize information clearly
- Support working memory
- Align with mental models

**Why**: Cognitive models inform interface design.

---

### Interaction Design

**How to Apply**:
- Reduce cognitive load
- Support information processing
- Enable pattern recognition
- Facilitate learning

**Why**: Cognitive models inform interaction design.

---

## Integration Points

### Design Intelligence
- Informs cognitive architecture layer
- Guides UX decisions
- Supports psychology modeling

### Knowledge Base
- Adds cognitive principles
- Tracks cognitive patterns
- Accumulates cognitive knowledge
