## Database Organization

### By Feasibility

**Organization**:
- Feasible features
- Marginal features
- Not feasible features

**Why**: Feasibility-based organization enables quick reference.

---

### By Category

**Organization**:
- Game features
- App features
- System features
- Technical features

**Why**: Category-based organization enables targeted search.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Add Entries

**Add entries when**:
- Feasibility evaluated
- Features implemented
- Outcomes known
- Lessons learned

**Why**: Accumulation creates value over time.

---

### How to Use Database

**Usage process**:
1. Search for similar features
2. Review feasibility assessments
3. Learn from outcomes
4. Apply lessons learned
5. Update database with new learnings

**Why**: Systematic usage maximizes value.
