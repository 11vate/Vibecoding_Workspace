# Failure Taxonomy

## Purpose

Organized taxonomy of failure types, enabling systematic failure analysis and prevention.

**Understanding failure types enables prevention.**

---

## Failure Categories

### Design Failures

**Failures in design**:

#### Experience Failures
- **Broken Fantasy**: Experience doesn't serve core fantasy
- **Emotional Mismatch**: Emotions don't match intent
- **Tonal Drift**: Experience drifts from intended tone
- **Anti-Pattern Violation**: Violates "must never become"

**Why**: Experience failures break user connection.

---

#### Psychology Failures
- **Cognitive Overload**: Too much information/choices
- **Misaligned Motivation**: Doesn't serve motivation loops
- **Poor Reward Timing**: Rewards mistimed
- **Failure Frustration**: Failures too frustrating

**Why**: Psychology failures reduce engagement.

---

#### Pacing Failures
- **Poor Pacing**: Pacing doesn't create engagement
- **No Tension**: Lacks tension/relief cycles
- **Monotony**: Becomes repetitive/boring
- **Rush**: Too fast, no time to appreciate

**Why**: Pacing failures reduce engagement.

---

### Technical Failures

**Failures in implementation**:

#### Architecture Failures
- **Poor Architecture**: Architecture doesn't support needs
- **Tight Coupling**: Systems too tightly coupled
- **Circular Dependencies**: Circular dependencies
- **No Modularity**: Lacks modularity

**Why**: Architecture failures cause maintenance problems.

---

#### Performance Failures
- **Slow Performance**: Performance unacceptable
- **Memory Leaks**: Memory not managed
- **Bottlenecks**: Performance bottlenecks
- **Poor Optimization**: Not optimized

**Why**: Performance failures harm user experience.

---

#### Scalability Failures
- **Doesn't Scale**: Can't handle growth
- **Poor Scaling**: Scales poorly
- **No Scaling Path**: No path to scale
- **Over-Engineering**: Over-engineered for scale

**Why**: Scalability failures limit growth.

---

### UX Failures

**Failures in user experience**:

#### Cognitive Load Failures
- **Too Much Information**: Information overload
- **Too Many Choices**: Choice overload
- **Unclear Organization**: Poor information architecture
- **No Learning Support**: Doesn't support learning

**Why**: Cognitive load failures overwhelm users.

---

#### Navigation Failures
- **Unclear Navigation**: Navigation confusing
- **Lost Users**: Users get lost
- **No Orientation**: No sense of location
- **Poor Flow**: Flow doesn't work

**Why**: Navigation failures frustrate users.

---

#### Feedback Failures
- **No Feedback**: Actions don't provide feedback
- **Unclear Feedback**: Feedback unclear
- **Delayed Feedback**: Feedback delayed
- **Wrong Feedback**: Feedback misleading

**Why**: Feedback failures confuse users.

---

### Engagement Failures

**Failures in engagement**:

#### Retention Failures
- **Low Retention**: Users don't return
- **No Hook**: Nothing brings users back
- **Boring**: Experience becomes boring
- **No Progression**: No sense of progress

**Why**: Retention failures reduce long-term engagement.

---

#### Progression Failures
- **No Progression**: No sense of advancement
- **Poor Progression**: Progression unsatisfying
- **Gated Progression**: Progression too gated
- **Meaningless Progression**: Progression doesn't matter

**Why**: Progression failures reduce motivation.

---

#### Motivation Failures
- **No Motivation**: No clear motivation
- **Weak Motivation**: Motivation too weak
- **Conflicting Motivation**: Motivations conflict
- **Lost Motivation**: Motivation lost over time

**Why**: Motivation failures reduce engagement.

---

## Failure Relationships

### Failure Chains

**How failures connect**:
- One failure causes another
- Failures compound
- Failure cascades

**Why**: Understanding chains prevents cascades.

---

### Failure Patterns

**Recurring failure patterns**:
- Common failure combinations
- Failure sequences
- Failure types that co-occur

**Why**: Patterns enable prevention.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference

**Reference taxonomy when**:
- Analyzing failures
- Preventing failures
- Designing systems
- Auditing projects

**Why**: Taxonomy enables systematic failure management.

---

### How to Use

**Usage process**:
1. Identify failure category
2. Find specific failure type
3. Review prevention strategies
4. Apply prevention
5. Monitor for failures

**Why**: Systematic usage prevents failures.

---

## Integration Points

### Failure Analysis Pipeline
- Used in failure analysis
- Organizes failures
- Enables systematic analysis

### Knowledge Base
- Adds to anti-patterns
- Tracks failure patterns
- Accumulates failure knowledge

---

**This taxonomy enables systematic failure analysis and prevention.**
