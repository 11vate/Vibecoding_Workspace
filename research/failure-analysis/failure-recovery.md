# Failure Recovery Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for recovering from failures, providing recovery strategies, damage assessment, and recovery protocols.

**Failures happen. Recovery enables continuation.**

## Recovery Strategies

### Design Failure Recovery

#### Experience Failure Recovery

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Assess damage (how far has experience drifted?)
2. Identify root cause (why did it drift?)
3. Realign with pillars (return to core fantasy)
4. Test realignment (validate return)
5. Monitor (prevent future drift)

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Return to experience pillars
- Remove anti-pattern features
- Reinforce emotional beats
- Restore tonal consistency

---

#### Psychology Failure Recovery

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Assess impact (how are users affected?)
2. Identify causes (why did psychology fail?)
3. Reduce cognitive load (simplify)
4. Restore motivation (reconnect to loops)
5. Test recovery (validate fixes)

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Simplify interfaces
- Restore motivation loops
- Fix reward timing
- Improve failure handling

---

### Technical Failure Recovery

#### Architecture Failure Recovery

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Assess damage (how broken is architecture?)
2. Identify problems (what's wrong?)
3. Plan refactoring (how to fix?)
4. Execute refactoring (fix architecture)
5. Validate (ensure fixes work)

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Refactor to modularity
- Break tight coupling
- Resolve circular dependencies
- Improve architecture

---

#### Performance Failure Recovery

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify bottlenecks (what's slow?)
2. Profile performance (measure)
3. Optimize (fix bottlenecks)
4. Test (validate improvements)
5. Monitor (prevent regression)

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Optimize bottlenecks
- Reduce memory usage
- Improve algorithms
- Cache appropriately

---

### UX Failure Recovery

#### Cognitive Load Failure Recovery

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Assess overload (how overloaded?)
2. Identify sources (what causes overload?)
3. Reduce load (simplify)
4. Test (validate reduction)
5. Monitor (prevent regression)

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Reduce information density
- Limit choices
- Improve organization
- Add progressive disclosure

---

#### Navigation Failure Recovery

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Assess navigation (how broken?)
2. Identify problems (what's wrong?)
3. Redesign navigation (fix)
4. Test (validate fixes)
5. Monitor (prevent regression)

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Clarify navigation structure
- Add orientation aids
- Improve wayfinding
- Test navigation

---

## Damage Assessment

### Assessment Framework

**What to Assess**:
- User impact (how are users affected?)
- System impact (how is system affected?)
- Data impact (is data at risk?)
- Reputation impact (how is reputation affected?)

**Why**: Assessment guides recovery priority.

---

### Recovery Priority

**Priority Levels**:
- **Critical**: Immediate user impact, data at risk
- **High**: Significant user impact, system problems
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, quality issues
- **Low**: Minor impact, polish issues

**Why**: Priority ensures critical issues addressed first.

---

## Recovery Protocols

### Immediate Response

**What to Do Immediately**:
- Assess damage
- Identify critical issues
- Implement quick fixes
- Communicate with users

**Why**: Immediate response limits damage.

---

### Short-Term Recovery

**What to Do Short-Term**:
- Fix critical issues
- Restore functionality
- Improve error handling
- Monitor closely

**Why**: Short-term recovery restores functionality.

---

### Long-Term Recovery

**What to Do Long-Term**:
- Root cause analysis
- Systematic fixes
- Prevention strategies
- Process improvements

**Why**: Long-term recovery prevents repetition.

---

## Integration Points

### Failure Taxonomy
- Recovery maps to taxonomy
- Organizes recovery
- Enables systematic recovery

### Knowledge Base
- Adds recovery strategies
- Tracks recovery effectiveness
- Accumulates recovery knowledge

---

**This guide enables systematic failure recovery through strategies, assessment, and protocols.**
