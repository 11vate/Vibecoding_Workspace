# Failure Prevention Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for preventing failures, providing strategies, early warning signs, and prevention protocols.

**Prevention is better than fixing. This guide enables prevention.**

## Prevention Strategies

### Design Failure Prevention

#### Experience Failure Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Maintain clear experience pillars
- Regular experience audits
- Test against "must never become"
- Validate emotional beats

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Experience drifts from pillars
- Emotional beats missing
- Anti-patterns appearing
- Tonal inconsistency

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. Define experience pillars clearly
2. Regular experience checks
3. Test emotional beats
4. Monitor for drift

---

#### Psychology Failure Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Respect cognitive limits
- Serve motivation loops
- Time rewards appropriately
- Handle failures gracefully

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Cognitive overload complaints
- Low engagement
- Poor retention
- User frustration

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. Assess cognitive load
2. Validate motivation loops
3. Test reward timing
4. Design failure recovery

---

### Technical Failure Prevention

#### Architecture Failure Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Design modular architecture
- Avoid tight coupling
- Prevent circular dependencies
- Plan for scaling

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Tight coupling appearing
- Circular dependencies
- Scaling problems
- Maintenance difficulties

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. Design modularly
2. Map dependencies
3. Test scalability
4. Regular architecture reviews

---

#### Performance Failure Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Set performance targets
- Monitor performance
- Optimize early
- Test performance

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Slow performance
- High memory usage
- Bottlenecks appearing
- User complaints

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. Set targets
2. Monitor metrics
3. Profile regularly
4. Optimize proactively

---

### UX Failure Prevention

#### Cognitive Load Failure Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Limit information density
- Progressive disclosure
- Organize information clearly
- Support learning

**Early Warning Signs**:
- User confusion
- High error rates
- Low completion rates
- User complaints

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. Assess cognitive load
2. Limit choices
3. Organize information
4. Test usability

---

#### Navigation Failure Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Clear navigation structure
- Provide orientation
- Test navigation
- Support wayfinding

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Users getting lost
- Navigation complaints
- Low task completion
- High support requests

**Prevention Protocol**:
1. Design clear navigation
2. Provide orientation
3. Test navigation
4. Monitor wayfinding

---

## Early Warning System

### Warning Signs

**What to Monitor**:
- User feedback
- Analytics data
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- Completion rates

**Why**: Early detection enables early prevention.

---

### Detection Methods

**How to Detect**:
- Regular audits
- User testing
- Analytics monitoring
- Performance profiling
- Error tracking

**Why**: Multiple detection methods ensure coverage.

---

## Prevention Protocols

### Design Phase Prevention

**During Design**:
- Check against failure patterns
- Validate assumptions
- Test mental models
- Assess cognitive load

**Why**: Prevention during design is most effective.

---

### Implementation Phase Prevention

**During Implementation**:
- Follow architecture patterns
- Monitor performance
- Test error handling
- Validate against blueprints

**Why**: Prevention during implementation catches issues early.

---

### Post-Implementation Prevention

**After Implementation**:
- Monitor for warning signs
- Regular audits
- User testing
- Performance monitoring

**Why**: Ongoing prevention maintains quality.

---

## Integration Points

### Failure Taxonomy
- Strategies map to taxonomy
- Organizes prevention
- Enables systematic prevention

### Knowledge Base
- Adds prevention strategies
- Tracks prevention effectiveness
- Accumulates prevention knowledge

---

**This guide enables systematic failure prevention through strategies, early warning, and protocols.**
