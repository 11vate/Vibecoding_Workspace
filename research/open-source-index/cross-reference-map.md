# Cross-Reference Map

## Purpose

This map shows relationships between open-source projects, enabling Cursor to understand project connections and learn from related work.

**Cross-referencing enables deeper understanding through relationships.**

## Map Structure

### By Similarity

**Projects grouped by similarity**:
- Similar mechanics
- Similar UX patterns
- Similar architecture
- Similar constraints

**Why**: Similar projects provide relevant references.

---

### By Relationship

**Projects connected by relationships**:
- Influenced by
- Influences
- Similar to
- Related to

**Why**: Relationships show knowledge flow.

---

### By Pattern

**Projects grouped by patterns**:
- Projects using same patterns
- Pattern variations
- Pattern evolution

**Why**: Pattern grouping shows pattern application.
