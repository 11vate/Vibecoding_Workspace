## Workflow Demonstration

### 1. Research Phase

See `/docs/research/comparative-analysis.md` for:
- How to research comparable systems
- How to extract lessons
- How to document findings

### 2. Design Intelligence Phase

See `/docs/design-intelligence/` for:
- How to define experience pillars
- How to document player psychology
- How to map core loops
- How to document systems

### 3. Blueprint Phase

See `/docs/blueprints/` for:
- How to create system blueprints
- How to specify data structures
- How to document integration points

### 4. Implementation Phase

See `/src/` for:
- How to implement from blueprints
- How to follow canonical structure
- How to integrate systems

## Key Learnings

1. **Research First** - Always research before designing
2. **Design Intelligence** - Use all 6 layers
3. **Blueprint Before Code** - Create blueprints first
4. **Follow Structure** - Use canonical spine
5. **Integrate Workspace** - Reference workspace docs

---

## Next Steps

1. Review the example project structure
2. Study the design intelligence docs
3. Examine the blueprints
4. Review the implementation
5. Apply to your own project
