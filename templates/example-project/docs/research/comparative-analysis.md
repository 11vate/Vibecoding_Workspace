# Comparative Analysis: Fusion Mechanics

## Similar Projects

### Pokemon Fusion (Fan Games)
- **What they do well**: Visual creativity, permanent results, simple mechanics
- **Where they break**: Can become repetitive, limited strategic depth
- **Lessons extracted**: Visual variety matters, permanence creates value

### Merge Dragons
- **What they do well**: Simple merge mechanics, clear progression, satisfying feedback
- **Where they break**: Can become grind-heavy, energy/stamina gating
- **Lessons extracted**: Simple rules work well, avoid excessive gating
