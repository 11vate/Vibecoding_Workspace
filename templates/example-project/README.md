# Example Project: Simple Fusion Game

This is a complete working example that demonstrates all Ultimate Cursor Vibecoding Workspace capabilities.

## What This Example Shows

1. **Design Intelligence Layers** - Complete design docs following all 6 layers
2. **Research → Synthesis → Blueprint → Implementation** workflow
3. **Knowledge Base Integration** - References to mechanics and patterns
4. **Blueprint System** - Sample blueprints for systems and UX
5. **Canonical Structure** - Complete project spine implementation
6. **PWA Capability** - Offline-capable, installable web app

## Project Overview

A simple fusion game where users combine creatures to create new ones. Demonstrates:
- Collection mechanics
- Fusion system
- Offline storage
- PWA architecture
- Design intelligence workflow

## Structure

This example includes:
- Complete design intelligence docs
- Sample research artifacts
- Sample blueprints
- Working implementation
- All workspace integrations

## How to Use

1. Review the design intelligence docs in `/docs/`
2. Check the research artifacts in `/docs/research/`
3. Review the blueprints in `/docs/blueprints/`
4. Explore the implementation in `/src/`
