# Research Doctrine

## Purpose

This document establishes research as a first-class discipline in the workspace, defining research philosophy, methodology, quality standards, and reuse protocols.

**Research is not optional. It is mandatory before design.**

---

## Research Philosophy

### Evidence-Based

**Principle**: Research must be evidence-based, not assumption-based.

**Application**:
- Use real data
- Reference actual projects
- Cite sources
- Validate findings

**Why**: Assumptions lead to poor decisions.

---

### Comparative

**Principle**: Research must compare multiple approaches.

**Application**:
- Compare 3+ approaches
- Analyze pros/cons
- Identify tradeoffs
- Extract principles

**Why**: Comparison reveals best approaches.

---

### Failure-Focused

**Principle**: Research must analyze failures, not just successes.

**Application**:
- Study failures
- Understand why they failed
- Extract prevention strategies
- Learn from mistakes

**Why**: Learning from failures prevents repetition.

---

## Research Methodology

### Systematic Process

**Research follows this process**:
1. Define research scope
2. Identify sources
3. Gather information
4. Analyze findings
5. Synthesize insights
6. Document results

**Why**: Systematic process ensures completeness.

---

### Multi-Source Research

**Research from multiple sources**:
- Open-source projects
- Academic research
- Industry reports
- User studies
- Case studies

**Why**: Multiple sources provide comprehensive understanding.

---

### Documented Research

**All research must be documented**:
- Research artifacts created
- Sources cited
- Findings recorded
- Insights extracted

**Why**: Documentation enables reuse and validation.

---

## Research Quality Standards

### Completeness

**Research is complete when**:
- ✅ Multiple sources consulted
- ✅ Comparable projects analyzed
- ✅ Patterns extracted
- ✅ Failures analyzed
- ✅ Insights synthesized
- ✅ Documentation created

**Why**: Completeness ensures quality.

---

### Validity

**Research is valid when**:
- ✅ Sources are credible
- ✅ Findings are evidence-based
- ✅ Analysis is thorough
- ✅ Conclusions are supported

**Why**: Validity ensures reliability.

---

### Reusability

**Research is reusable when**:
- ✅ Well-documented
- ✅ Clearly structured
- ✅ Cross-referenced
- ✅ Accessible

**Why**: Reusability maximizes value.

---

## Research Reuse Protocols

### Cross-Project Reuse

**How to reuse research**:
- Reference existing research
- Extract applicable insights
- Adapt to new context
- Update research as needed

**Why**: Reuse accelerates research.

---

### Knowledge Accumulation

**How research accumulates**:
- Add to knowledge base
- Update pattern libraries
- Document insights
- Share learnings

**Why**: Accumulation creates value over time.

---

## Research Types

### Comparative Analysis

**Purpose**: Compare similar projects/systems.

**Output**: Comparative analysis document

**When to Use**: When designing similar systems.

---

### Pattern Extraction

**Purpose**: Extract reusable patterns.

**Output**: Pattern library entries

**When to Use**: When identifying reusable solutions.

---

### Failure Analysis

**Purpose**: Learn from failures.

**Output**: Failure analysis document

**When to Use**: When avoiding known mistakes.

---

### Technical Feasibility

**Purpose**: Evaluate technical feasibility.

**Output**: Feasibility report

**When to Use**: When assessing implementation possibility.

---

### UX Psychology

**Purpose**: Ground UX in psychology.

**Output**: Psychology-based design guide

**When to Use**: When designing user experiences.

---

## Research Integration

### With Design Intelligence

**How research informs design**:
- Experience pillars informed by research
- Psychology grounded in research
- Systems designed from research
- UX based on research

**Why**: Research grounds design in reality.

---

### With Knowledge Base

**How research builds knowledge**:
- Patterns added to libraries
- Insights accumulated
- Wisdom indexed
- Knowledge cross-referenced

**Why**: Research builds knowledge base.

---

## Research Enforcement

### Mandatory Research

**Research is mandatory for**:
- New features
- New systems
- Significant changes
- Unfamiliar domains

**Why**: Research prevents mistakes.

---

### Research Gates

**Research gates before**:
- Design synthesis
- Blueprint creation
- Implementation

**Why**: Gates ensure research happens.

---

## Success Indicators

Research succeeds when:
- ✅ Research is systematic
- ✅ Multiple sources consulted
- ✅ Findings are evidence-based
- ✅ Failures are analyzed
- ✅ Insights are extracted
- ✅ Knowledge is accumulated
- ✅ Research is reusable

---

**This doctrine establishes research as a first-class discipline, ensuring all design is grounded in evidence and learning.**
