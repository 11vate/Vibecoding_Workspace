# Vibecoding Philosophy

This directory contains the core philosophy and educational framework for "Vibecoding" - an AI-assisted development methodology emphasizing aesthetics, psychology, and human experience.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The ABCD Framework (Vibe Translation)
- **A**tmosphere: The overall feeling and mood
- **B**ehaviors: How the system reacts and interacts
- **C**omponents: The building blocks
- **D**etails: The finishing touches and polish

### 2. AI Collaboration Workflows
- **Divide & Conquer**: Breaking down complex vibes into manageable technical tasks.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Polishing the "vibe" through successive AI interactions.
- **Vibe-First Development**: Prioritizing the emotional resonance of the software before the technical implementation.
