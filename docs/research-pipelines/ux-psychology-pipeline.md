# UX Psychology Pipeline

## Purpose

Systematic pipeline for grounding UX decisions in psychological research, ensuring designs align with how users actually think and behave.

**This pipeline prevents designing based on assumptions instead of psychological research.**

---

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Cognitive Model Research

**What to Do**:
- Research cognitive models relevant to design
- Document mental models
- Identify cognitive load factors
- Assess information processing

**Output**: Cognitive model analysis

**Research Areas**:
- Working memory limits
- Attention mechanisms
- Decision-making processes
- Learning patterns
- Pattern recognition

---

### Stage 2: Emotional Design Research

**What to Do**:
- Research emotional design principles
- Document emotional responses
- Identify emotional triggers
- Assess emotional impact

**Output**: Emotional design analysis

**Research Areas**:
- Visceral responses
- Behavioral responses
- Reflective responses
- Emotional memory
- Emotional recovery

---

### Stage 3: Behavioral Pattern Research

**What to Do**:
- Research behavioral patterns
- Document decision-making biases
- Identify behavioral triggers
- Assess behavioral impact

**Output**: Behavioral pattern analysis

**Research Areas**:
- Loss aversion
- Anchoring
- Social proof
- Scarcity
- Framing effects

---

### Stage 4: Accessibility Research

**What to Do**:
- Research accessibility requirements
- Document accessibility patterns
- Identify accessibility barriers
- Assess accessibility impact

**Output**: Accessibility analysis

**Research Areas**:
- Visual accessibility
- Motor accessibility
- Cognitive accessibility
- Auditory accessibility
- Universal design

---

### Stage 5: Psychology Synthesis

**What to Do**:
- Synthesize psychological research
- Extract design principles
- Create design guidelines
- Document application strategies

**Output**: Psychology-based design guide

**Synthesis Format**:
```markdown
