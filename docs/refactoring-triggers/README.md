# Refactoring Triggers

## Purpose

Define when refactoring is needed, enabling proactive code improvement and preventing technical debt.

**Refactoring triggers enable proactive improvement.**

---

## Trigger Types

### Code Smell Triggers

**When to Refactor**:
- Code smells detected
- Duplication found
- Complexity too high
- Poor naming

**Why**: Code smells indicate problems.

---

### Architecture Triggers

**When to Refactor**:
- Tight coupling detected
- Circular dependencies
- Poor modularity
- Architecture drift

**Why**: Architecture problems cause maintenance issues.

---

### Performance Triggers

**When to Refactor**:
- Performance below targets
- Bottlenecks identified
- Memory leaks detected
- Optimization needed

**Why**: Performance problems affect user experience.

---

### Maintainability Triggers

**When to Refactor**:
- Hard to understand
- Hard to test
- Hard to extend
- Hard to debug

**Why**: Maintainability problems slow development.

---

## Trigger Detection

### Automated Detection

**How to Detect**:
- Code analysis tools
- Complexity metrics
- Dependency analysis
- Performance profiling

**Why**: Automation enables early detection.

---

### Manual Detection

**How to Detect**:
- Code reviews
- Developer feedback
- User complaints
- Testing issues

**Why**: Manual detection catches what automation misses.

---

## Refactoring Process

### Step 1: Identify Trigger

**What to Do**:
- Detect trigger
- Assess severity
- Document issue
- Prioritize

**Output**: Trigger identification

---

### Step 2: Plan Refactoring

**What to Do**:
- Analyze current code
- Design improved code
- Plan refactoring steps
- Estimate effort

**Output**: Refactoring plan

---

### Step 3: Execute Refactoring

**What to Do**:
- Execute refactoring steps
- Test changes
- Verify improvements
- Document changes

**Output**: Refactored code

---

### Step 4: Validate Refactoring

**What to Do**:
- Validate improvements
- Check for regressions
- Update documentation
- Share learnings

**Output**: Validation results

---

## Integration Points
