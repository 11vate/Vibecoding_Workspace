# Cross-Project Reasoning

## Purpose

This document defines how Cursor reasons across multiple projects, applying learnings from one project to another.

**Cross-project reasoning enables knowledge transfer and consistency.**

---

## Reasoning Principles

### 1. Pattern Recognition

**Principle**: Recognize patterns across projects.

**How to Apply**:
- Identify similar problems
- Recognize pattern matches
- Apply proven solutions
- Adapt as needed

**Why**: Patterns repeat across projects.

---

### 2. Knowledge Transfer

**Principle**: Transfer knowledge from completed projects.

**How to Apply**:
- Extract lessons learned
- Document insights
- Share knowledge
- Apply to new projects

**Why**: Knowledge transfer accelerates development.

---

### 3. Consistency Maintenance

**Principle**: Maintain consistency across projects.

**How to Apply**:
- Use proven patterns
- Follow established conventions
- Maintain design language
- Ensure compatibility

**Why**: Consistency improves quality and reduces learning curve.

---

### 4. Adaptation Strategy

**Principle**: Adapt, don't copy.

**How to Apply**:
- Understand context differences
- Identify required adaptations
- Modify appropriately
- Test adaptations

**Why**: Contexts differ. Adaptation is necessary.

## Cross-Project Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Similarity

**What to Do**:
- Compare current project to past projects
- Identify similar problems
- Recognize pattern matches
- Assess similarity level

**Output**: Similarity assessment

---

### Step 2: Extract Knowledge

**What to Do**:
- Review past project documentation
- Extract relevant patterns
- Identify lessons learned
- Document insights

**Output**: Extracted knowledge

---

### Step 3: Assess Applicability

**What to Do**:
- Compare contexts
- Identify differences
- Assess pattern fit
- Evaluate adaptation needs

**Output**: Applicability assessment

---

### Step 4: Adapt and Apply

**What to Do**:
- Adapt patterns to context
- Modify as needed
- Apply adapted patterns
- Test application

**Output**: Adapted application

---

### Step 5: Document Learning

**What to Do**:
- Document adaptation
- Record outcomes
- Update knowledge base
- Share insights

**Output**: Updated knowledge

---

## Tools for Cross-Project Reasoning

### Pattern Matcher

**Purpose**: Match patterns across projects.

**How It Works**:
- Analyzes project structures
- Identifies pattern matches
- Suggests applicable patterns
- Provides adaptation guidance

**Location**: `tools/pattern-matcher/`

---

### Insight Extractor

**Purpose**: Extract insights from completed projects.

**How It Works**:
- Analyzes project documentation
- Extracts key insights
- Identifies lessons learned
- Creates knowledge entries

**Location**: `tools/insight-extractor/`

---

## Integration Points

### Knowledge Base
- Reference accumulated wisdom
- Use pattern libraries
- Apply cross-project insights

### Design Intelligence
- Inform design decisions
- Guide pattern selection
- Support reasoning

---

## Success Indicators

Cross-project reasoning succeeds when:
- ✅ Patterns are recognized across projects
- ✅ Knowledge is transferred effectively
- ✅ Consistency is maintained
- ✅ Adaptations are appropriate
- ✅ Learning is documented

---

**This document enables Cursor to reason across projects, applying learnings and maintaining consistency.**
