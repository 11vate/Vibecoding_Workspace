# System Interaction Maps

## Purpose

Visual mapping of system interactions, identifying where emergence can occur and how to design for it.

**Interaction maps reveal emergence potential.**

---

## Map Structure

### Interaction Types

**Direct Interactions**:
- System A directly affects System B
- Explicit connections
- Predictable outcomes
- Designed interactions

**Indirect Interactions**:
- System A affects System C, which affects System B
- Implicit connections
- Unpredictable outcomes
- Emergent interactions

**Why**: Understanding interaction types reveals emergence potential.

---

### Interaction Strength

**Strong Interactions**:
- Large effects
- Direct connections
- Immediate impact
- Predictable

**Weak Interactions**:
- Small effects
- Indirect connections
- Delayed impact
- Unpredictable

**Why**: Interaction strength affects emergence.

## Map Creation

### Step 1: Identify Systems

**What to Do**:
- List all systems
- Document system purposes
- Note system boundaries
- Identify system capabilities

**Output**: System inventory

---

### Step 2: Map Direct Interactions

**What to Do**:
- Identify direct connections
- Document interaction types
- Note interaction strength
- Map interaction flow

**Output**: Direct interaction map

---

### Step 3: Identify Indirect Interactions

**What to Do**:
- Trace indirect paths
- Identify chain reactions
- Note potential emergence
- Map indirect flows

**Output**: Indirect interaction map

---

### Step 4: Analyze Emergence Potential

**What to Do**:
- Identify emergence opportunities
- Assess emergence value
- Plan emergence support
- Design emergence control

**Output**: Emergence analysis

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Linear Chain

**Pattern**: A → B → C → D

**Emergence Potential**: Low (predictable)

**Use Case**: Controlled progression.

---

### Network

**Pattern**: Multiple systems interact.

**Emergence Potential**: High (complex)

**Use Case**: Emergent behavior.

---

### Feedback Loop

**Pattern**: System affects itself.

**Emergence Potential**: Medium (dynamic)

**Use Case**: Dynamic systems.

---

## Integration Points

### Layer 4 (Systems Map)
- Interaction maps extend systems map
- Systems map shows structure
- Interaction maps show dynamics

### Emergence Framework
- Maps identify emergence potential
- Framework guides emergence design
- Maps support framework

## How Cursor Uses Interaction Maps

### When Designing Systems

Cursor must:
1. **Map system interactions** - Direct and indirect
2. **Identify emergence potential** - Where emergence can occur
3. **Design for emergence** - Enable positive emergence
4. **Control emergence** - Prevent negative emergence

**Never design systems without interaction maps.**

---

### When Evaluating Designs

Cursor must ask:
- Are interactions mapped?
- Is emergence potential identified?
- Is emergence designed for?
- Is emergence controlled?

**Never accept designs without interaction maps.**

---

## Success Indicators

Interaction maps succeed when:
- ✅ All interactions are mapped
- ✅ Emergence potential is identified
- ✅ Positive emergence is enabled
- ✅ Negative emergence is prevented
- ✅ Systems create valuable emergence
