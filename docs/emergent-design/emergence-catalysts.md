# Emergence Catalysts

## Purpose

Catalog of catalysts that trigger emergence, enabling Cursor to design systems that create valuable emergent behavior.

**Catalysts trigger emergence. Understanding catalysts enables emergence design.**

---

## Catalyst Types

### Parameter Tuning

**Catalyst**: Tunable parameters create variety.

**How It Works**:
- Parameters affect system behavior
- Different values create different outcomes
- Players can tune parameters
- Tuning creates variety

**Design Implications**:
- Expose tunable parameters
- Enable parameter experimentation
- Show parameter effects
- Support parameter discovery

**Why**: Parameter tuning creates mechanical emergence.

---

### System Combinations

**Catalyst**: Systems combine in new ways.

**How It Works**:
- Multiple systems interact
- Combinations create new behaviors
- Players discover combinations
- Combinations enable strategies

**Design Implications**:
- Enable system combinations
- Support combination discovery
- Reward combination use
- Document combination potential

**Why**: System combinations create strategic emergence.

---

### Player Creativity

**Catalyst**: Players find creative uses.

**How It Works**:
- Systems allow flexibility
- Players experiment
- Creative uses emerge
- Community shares discoveries

**Design Implications**:
- Allow system flexibility
- Enable experimentation
- Support creativity
- Facilitate sharing

**Why**: Player creativity creates social emergence.

---

### Unintended Interactions

**Catalyst**: Systems interact unexpectedly.

**How It Works**:
- Systems interact in unplanned ways
- Unexpected behaviors emerge
- Players discover interactions
- Interactions create value

**Design Implications**:
- Allow system flexibility
- Monitor for emergence
- Support positive emergence
- Prevent negative emergence

**Why**: Unintended interactions create surprise emergence.

## Catalyst Design

### Enabling Catalysts

**How to Enable**:
- Provide tunable parameters
- Enable system combinations
- Allow player creativity
- Monitor for emergence

**Why**: Enabling creates emergence potential.

---

### Controlling Catalysts

**How to Control**:
- Set parameter bounds
- Guide combinations
- Monitor creativity
- Prevent negative emergence

**Why**: Control prevents problems.

---

### Harnessing Catalysts

**How to Harness**:
- Identify valuable emergence
- Support positive catalysts
- Learn from emergence
- Evolve systems

**Why**: Harnessing maximizes value.

---

## Integration Points

### Emergence Framework
- Catalysts trigger emergence
- Framework guides catalyst use
- Catalysts support framework

### System Interaction Maps
- Maps show catalyst potential
- Catalysts use interaction maps
- Maps guide catalyst design

---

## How Cursor Uses Catalysts

### When Designing Systems

Cursor must:
1. **Design catalysts** - Parameters, combinations, creativity
2. **Enable catalysts** - Make catalysts accessible
3. **Control catalysts** - Set bounds, guide use
4. **Harness catalysts** - Identify value, support positive

**Never design systems without considering catalysts.**

---

### When Evaluating Designs

Cursor must ask:
- Are catalysts present?
- Are catalysts enabled?
- Are catalysts controlled?
- Are catalysts harnessed?

**Never accept designs without catalysts.**

---

## Success Indicators

Emergence catalysts succeed when:
- ✅ Catalysts are present
- ✅ Catalysts are enabled
- ✅ Catalysts are controlled
- ✅ Valuable emergence occurs
- ✅ Users discover new possibilities
