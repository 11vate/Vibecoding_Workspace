# Reward Scheduling

## Purpose

Systematic design of reward schedules, ensuring rewards maintain motivation without becoming predictable or losing value.

**Proper reward scheduling maintains motivation. Poor scheduling reduces motivation.**

---

## Reward Types

### Immediate Rewards

**Purpose**: Instant feedback and satisfaction.

**Examples**:
- Visual feedback
- Audio feedback
- Immediate recognition
- Instant gratification

**When to Use**: Every action, immediate feedback.

**Why**: Immediate rewards provide instant satisfaction.

---

### Short-Term Rewards

**Purpose**: Session-based motivation.

**Examples**:
- Progress rewards
- Completion rewards
- Session milestones
- Quick achievements

**When to Use**: Within session, frequent but meaningful.

**Why**: Short-term rewards maintain session engagement.

---

### Long-Term Rewards

**Purpose**: Retention and return motivation.

**Examples**:
- Major milestones
- Rare achievements
- Collection completion
- Significant unlocks

**When to Use**: Across sessions, infrequent but valuable.

**Why**: Long-term rewards drive return.

---

## Reward Schedules

### Fixed Schedule

**Pattern**: Rewards at fixed intervals.

**Characteristics**:
- Predictable
- Consistent
- Reliable
- Can become expected

**Use Case**: Progress-based rewards.

**Why**: Fixed schedule provides reliability.

---

### Variable Schedule

**Pattern**: Rewards at variable intervals.

**Characteristics**:
- Unpredictable
- Surprising
- Engaging
- Maintains interest

**Use Case**: Surprise rewards, discovery.

**Why**: Variable schedule maintains interest.

---

### Ratio Schedule

**Pattern**: Rewards after N actions.

**Characteristics**:
- Action-based
- Effort-reward link
- Clear progression
- Motivates action

**Use Case**: Action-based progression.

**Why**: Ratio schedule links effort to reward.

## Reward Design Principles

### 1. Immediate Feedback

**Principle**: Every action gets immediate feedback.

**Application**: Visual, audio, haptic feedback.

**Why**: Immediate feedback maintains engagement.

---

### 2. Meaningful Rewards

**Principle**: Rewards must feel meaningful.

**Application**: Valuable, relevant, appropriate rewards.

**Why**: Meaningful rewards maintain motivation.

---

### 3. Varied Rewards

**Principle**: Vary reward types and timing.

**Application**: Different rewards, varied schedules.

**Why**: Variety prevents predictability.

---

### 4. Appropriate Timing

**Principle**: Time rewards appropriately.

**Application**: Immediate for feedback, delayed for value.

**Why**: Timing affects reward value.

---

### 5. Prevent Predictability

**Principle**: Avoid completely predictable rewards.

**Application**: Add surprise, vary timing.

**Why**: Predictability reduces motivation.

---

## Reward Value Management

### Value Perception

**What Affects Value**:
- Rarity
- Effort required
- Meaningfulness
- Context

**Design Implications**:
- Balance rarity
- Link to effort
- Create meaning
- Consider context

**Why**: Value perception affects motivation.

---

### Value Decay

**How Value Decays**:
- Over-exposure
- Predictability
- Decreased rarity
- Lost meaning

**Prevention**:
- Limit exposure
- Add surprise
- Maintain rarity
- Refresh meaning

**Why**: Preventing decay maintains motivation.

## Integration with Other Layers

### Layer 2 (Player Psychology)
- Rewards serve motivation loops
- Timing respects psychology
- Value aligns with psychology

### Layer 12 (Motivation Systems)
- Rewards support motivation loops
- Scheduling maintains motivation
- Value supports motivation

## How Cursor Uses Reward Scheduling

### When Designing Systems

Cursor must:
1. **Design reward types** - Immediate, short-term, long-term
2. **Choose reward schedules** - Fixed, variable, ratio
3. **Apply design principles** - Immediate feedback, meaningful, varied
4. **Manage reward value** - Perception, decay prevention

**Never design systems without reward scheduling.**

---

### When Evaluating Designs

Cursor must ask:
- Are rewards scheduled appropriately?
- Is reward variety present?
- Is reward value managed?
- Is predictability prevented?

**Never accept designs without reward scheduling.**

---

## Success Indicators

Reward scheduling succeeds when:
- ✅ Rewards are scheduled appropriately
- ✅ Reward variety exists
- ✅ Reward value is maintained
- ✅ Predictability is prevented
- ✅ Motivation is sustained
