# Design Intelligence Layer 7: Design Thinking

## Purpose

Design Thinking forces Cursor to think through multiple design dimensions simultaneously, preventing solution-first thinking and ensuring user-centered design.

**This layer prevents designing without understanding users.**

---

## Design Thinking Methodology

Design Thinking follows five stages that Cursor must navigate:

### 1. Empathize

**What Cursor Must Do**:
- Understand users deeply
- Research user needs, desires, pain points
- Observe user behavior
- Gather user insights

**Questions Cursor Must Answer**:
- Who are the users?
- What are their needs?
- What problems do they face?
- What motivates them?
- What frustrates them?

**Output**: User empathy map, user personas, user journey maps

**Why**: Prevents designing for assumptions instead of real users.

---

### 2. Define

**What Cursor Must Do**:
- Synthesize research findings
- Define the problem clearly
- Identify core user needs
- Frame the problem statement

**Questions Cursor Must Answer**:
- What is the core problem?
- What are the key user needs?
- What constraints exist?
- What success looks like?

**Output**: Problem statement, user needs definition, constraints list

**Why**: Prevents solving the wrong problem.

---

### 3. Ideate

**What Cursor Must Do**:
- Generate multiple solutions
- Think divergently
- Explore different approaches
- Consider wild ideas

**Questions Cursor Must Answer**:
- What are different ways to solve this?
- What if we tried X?
- How might we approach this differently?
- What are the edge cases?

**Output**: Multiple solution concepts, ideation maps, concept variations

**Why**: Prevents settling on first solution.

---

### 4. Prototype

**What Cursor Must Do**:
- Create low-fidelity prototypes
- Test concepts quickly
- Iterate rapidly
- Learn from failures

**Questions Cursor Must Answer**:
- How can we test this quickly?
- What's the simplest version?
- What assumptions can we validate?
- What might fail?

**Output**: Prototypes, test plans, validation criteria

**Why**: Prevents building wrong solutions.

---

### 5. Test

**What Cursor Must Do**:
- Test with users
- Gather feedback
- Iterate based on learnings
- Refine solutions

**Questions Cursor Must Answer**:
- What did users think?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What needs to change?
- What did we learn?

**Output**: Test results, feedback analysis, iteration plans

**Why**: Ensures solutions actually work for users.

---

## Design Thinking Principles

### 1. Human-Centered

**Principle**: Always start with users, not solutions.

**Application**: Research users before designing solutions.

**Why**: Solutions that don't serve users fail.

---

### 2. Iterative

**Principle**: Design is iterative, not linear.

**Application**: Prototype, test, iterate, repeat.

**Why**: First solutions are rarely best solutions.

---

### 3. Collaborative

**Principle**: Design benefits from multiple perspectives.

**Application**: Cross-reference knowledge base, research multiple approaches.

**Why**: Single perspective limits solutions.

---

### 4. Experimental

**Principle**: Treat design as experiments.

**Application**: Test assumptions, validate hypotheses.

**Why**: Assumptions are often wrong.

---

### 5. Holistic

**Principle**: Consider entire experience, not just features.

**Application**: Design end-to-end experiences.

**Why**: Features don't exist in isolation.

## How Cursor Uses This Layer

### When Starting a Project

Cursor must:
1. **Empathize** - Research users deeply
2. **Define** - Clearly define the problem
3. **Ideate** - Generate multiple solutions
4. **Prototype** - Create testable concepts
5. **Test** - Validate with users

**Never skip stages. Never design without empathy.**

---

### When Designing Features

Cursor must:
- Start with user needs (Empathize)
- Define the problem clearly (Define)
- Generate multiple approaches (Ideate)
- Create testable prototypes (Prototype)
- Validate with users (Test)

**Never jump to solution without understanding users.**

---

### When Evaluating Solutions

Cursor must ask:
- Does this serve user needs? (Empathize)
- Does this solve the right problem? (Define)
- Are there better approaches? (Ideate)
- Can we test this? (Prototype)
- Will users actually use this? (Test)

**Never assume solutions are correct without validation.**

### Layer 2 (Player Psychology)
- Empathize understands user psychology

## Failure Prevention

This layer prevents:
- ❌ Designing without understanding users
- ❌ Solving the wrong problem
- ❌ Settling on first solution
- ❌ Building without testing
- ❌ Assuming solutions work

**Design Thinking ensures user-centered, validated solutions.**

---

## Success Indicators

Design Thinking succeeds when:
- ✅ Cursor researches users before designing
- ✅ Cursor defines problems clearly
- ✅ Cursor generates multiple solutions
- ✅ Cursor creates testable prototypes
- ✅ Cursor validates with users
- ✅ Solutions serve real user needs

---

**This layer ensures Cursor designs for users, not assumptions. It prevents solution-first thinking and ensures user-centered design.**
