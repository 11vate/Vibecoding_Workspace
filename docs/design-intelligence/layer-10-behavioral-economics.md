# Design Intelligence Layer 10: Behavioral Economics

## Purpose

Behavioral Economics applies psychological insights to design, optimizing engagement through understanding how users actually make decisions (not how they should).

**This layer prevents designing based on rational user assumptions instead of actual user behavior.**

---

## Core Behavioral Economics Principles

### 1. Loss Aversion

**Principle**: Losses feel twice as bad as equivalent gains feel good.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Frame rewards as avoiding loss
- Highlight what users might lose
- Create scarcity and urgency
- Emphasize risk of inaction

**Design Applications**:
- "Don't lose your progress" vs "Save your progress"
- Limited-time offers
- Streak systems (don't break the streak)
- Risk/reward decisions

**Why**: Loss aversion is stronger than gain seeking.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents ignoring loss aversion, missing engagement opportunities.

---

### 2. Anchoring

**Principle**: First information influences subsequent decisions.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Set appropriate anchors
- Use reference points
- Show comparisons
- Establish value context

**Design Applications**:
- Price comparisons (original vs. sale)
- Progress indicators (start vs. current)
- Achievement comparisons (you vs. others)
- Value framing (what you get vs. what it costs)

**Why**: Anchors influence perception of value.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents poor value perception from bad anchors.

---

### 3. Endowment Effect

**Principle**: People value things more when they own them.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Create ownership feelings
- Enable customization
- Show personal collections
- Emphasize "yours"

**Design Applications**:
- "Your collection" vs "The collection"
- Customization options
- Personal achievements
- Ownership language

**Why**: Ownership increases value perception.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents missing opportunities to create ownership feelings.

---

### 4. Social Proof

**Principle**: People follow what others do.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Show what others are doing
- Display popularity
- Highlight community activity
- Use testimonials

**Design Applications**:
- "X users are doing Y"
- Popular items
- Community activity feeds
- User testimonials

**Why**: Social proof influences behavior.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents missing social influence opportunities.

---

### 5. Scarcity

**Principle**: Scarcity increases perceived value.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Create legitimate scarcity
- Show limited availability
- Use time limits
- Highlight exclusivity

**Design Applications**:
- Limited edition items
- Time-limited offers
- "Only X left"
- Exclusive access

**Why**: Scarcity increases desire and urgency.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents missing scarcity opportunities (but avoid fake scarcity).

---

### 6. Framing

**Principle**: How information is framed affects decisions.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Frame positively or negatively
- Emphasize gains or losses
- Use comparative framing
- Highlight different aspects

**Design Applications**:
- "90% success rate" vs "10% failure rate"
- "Save $10" vs "Spend $90"
- Comparative options
- Benefit-focused messaging

**Why**: Framing influences perception and decisions.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents poor framing that reduces engagement.

---

### 7. Defaults

**Principle**: Defaults are powerful - most users accept them.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Set beneficial defaults
- Make defaults easy to change
- Use defaults to guide behavior
- Consider default impact

**Design Applications**:
- Opt-in vs opt-out
- Default settings
- Recommended options
- Suggested actions

**Why**: Defaults guide behavior without forcing it.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents poor defaults that harm users.

---

### 8. Commitment and Consistency

**Principle**: People want to be consistent with past commitments.

**What Cursor Must Consider**:
- Get small commitments first
- Enable public commitments
- Show consistency
- Reward consistency

**Design Applications**:
- Onboarding commitments
- Public goals
- Consistency tracking
- Streak systems

**Why**: Commitment increases follow-through.

**Failure Prevention**: Prevents missing commitment opportunities.

---

## Behavioral Economics Patterns

### Nudge Patterns

**Definition**: Subtle design changes that guide behavior without forcing.

**Examples**:
- Default options
- Visual cues
- Placement
- Timing

**Why**: Nudges guide without coercion.

---

### Incentive Patterns

**Definition**: Rewards that motivate desired behavior.

**Examples**:
- Achievement systems
- Progress rewards
- Completion bonuses
- Streak rewards

**Why**: Incentives motivate behavior.

---

### Feedback Patterns

**Definition**: Information that guides behavior.

**Examples**:
- Progress indicators
- Comparison displays
- Social activity
- Performance metrics

**Why**: Feedback guides behavior.

---

## How Cursor Uses This Layer

### When Designing Engagement Systems

Cursor must:
1. **Apply loss aversion** - Frame rewards as avoiding loss
2. **Set anchors** - Establish value context
3. **Create ownership** - Enable personalization
4. **Show social proof** - Display community activity
5. **Use scarcity** - Create legitimate scarcity
6. **Frame effectively** - Frame information positively
7. **Set defaults** - Use beneficial defaults
8. **Enable commitment** - Get small commitments

**Never design engagement systems without behavioral economics principles.**

---

### When Evaluating Designs

Cursor must ask:
- Does this leverage loss aversion?
- Are anchors set appropriately?
- Does this create ownership?
- Is social proof displayed?
- Is scarcity used effectively?
- Is framing optimal?
- Are defaults beneficial?
- Does this enable commitment?

**Never accept designs that ignore behavioral economics.**

---

### When Creating Features

Cursor must ensure:
- Features leverage behavioral principles
- Features use appropriate nudges
- Features provide incentives
- Features give feedback
- Features respect user autonomy

**Never add features that ignore how users actually behave.**

## Integration with Other Layers

### Layer 2 (Player Psychology)
- Behavioral economics informs motivation loops
- Nudges support motivation
- Incentives align with psychology

### Layer 3 (Core Loop)
- Behavioral principles reinforce core loop
- Nudges guide loop actions
- Feedback supports loop progression

### Layer 8 (Emotional Design)
- Behavioral economics creates emotional responses
- Loss aversion creates tension
- Scarcity creates excitement

## Behavioral Economics Tools

### Analysis Tools
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Nudge identification
- Incentive design
- Feedback systems

### Testing Tools
- A/B testing

- Conversion analysis

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Ethical Use

**Principles**:
- Respect user autonomy
- Avoid manipulation
- Be transparent
- Provide value

**Why**: Behavioral economics can be manipulative. Use ethically.

---

### Avoid Dark Patterns

**Don't**:
- Create fake scarcity
- Use deceptive framing
- Force commitments
- Hide information

**Why**: Dark patterns harm trust and long-term engagement.

## Failure Prevention

This layer prevents:
- ❌ Designing for rational users instead of actual users
- ❌ Missing engagement opportunities
- ❌ Poor value perception
- ❌ Weak motivation systems
- ❌ Ignoring behavioral principles

**Behavioral Economics optimizes engagement through understanding actual user behavior.**

---

## Success Indicators

Behavioral Economics succeeds when:
- ✅ Engagement systems leverage behavioral principles
- ✅ Users make desired decisions
- ✅ Value perception is optimized
- ✅ Motivation systems are effective
- ✅ Behavior is guided ethically
- ✅ Long-term engagement increases
