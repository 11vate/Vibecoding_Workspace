# Design Intelligence Layer 5: Mechanic Evolution

## Purpose

Mechanic Evolution defines **how systems grow over time** - what gets introduced when, and why. This document answers: "How does complexity increase? What unlocks when? How does the experience deepen?"

**This prevents Cursor from overengineering too early and ensures systems scale appropriately.**

---

## Document Structure

Every project should have a `mechanic-evolution.md` file that defines:

### 1. Early Game (Simplicity)

**What users experience first** - simple, clear, focused.

- **Core mechanics** - What's available immediately
- **Complexity level** - How simple it is
- **Learning goals** - What users learn
- **Constraints** - What's intentionally limited

**Why it matters**: Cursor ensures early game is accessible and teaches fundamentals.

---

### 2. Mid Game (Depth)

**How complexity increases** - new systems, deeper mechanics.

- **New mechanics** - What gets introduced
- **Complexity increase** - How it deepens
- **Mastery goals** - What users master
- **Unlocks** - What becomes available

**Why it matters**: Cursor ensures mid game adds depth without overwhelming.

---

### 3. Late Game (Emergence)

**How systems interact** - complex interactions, emergent behavior.

- **System interactions** - How systems combine
- **Emergent behavior** - What emerges from interactions
- **Expertise goals** - What experts discover
- **Endgame content** - What keeps experts engaged

**Why it matters**: Cursor ensures late game has depth and discovery.

---

### 4. Introduction Timeline

**When mechanics are introduced** - pacing and progression.

- **Session 1** - What's available immediately
- **Session 2-5** - What unlocks early
- **Session 6-20** - What unlocks mid-game
- **Session 21+** - What unlocks late-game

**Why it matters**: Cursor ensures mechanics are introduced at the right pace.

---

### 5. Evolution Triggers

**What causes evolution** - unlocks, milestones, progression.

- **Unlock conditions** - What triggers new mechanics
- **Milestone gates** - What gates progression
- **Progression paths** - How users advance
- **Branching** - How paths diverge

**Why it matters**: Cursor ensures evolution feels natural and earned.

## Evolution Principles

### 1. Start Simple

Early game should be immediately understandable.

### 2. Add Depth Gradually

Complexity increases over time, not all at once.

### 3. Build on Foundations

New mechanics build on what users already know.

### 4. Enable Mastery

Each stage enables deeper mastery of systems.

### 5. Create Emergence

Late game creates emergent behavior from system interactions.

---

## How Cursor Uses This

### When Designing Features

Cursor checks:
1. Is this appropriate for the current stage?
2. Does this build on existing mechanics?
3. Does this add depth without complexity?
4. Does this enable mastery?

### When Evaluating Complexity

Cursor asks:
- "Is this too complex for early game?"
- "Does this add depth or just complexity?"
- "Does this build on what users know?"
- "Does this enable mastery?"

### When Planning Progression

Cursor considers:
- When should this unlock?
- What should users master first?
- How does this build on previous mechanics?
- What does this enable later?

- **Layer 1 (Experience Pillars)**: Evolution preserves the fantasy
- **Layer 2 (Player Psychology)**: Evolution respects cognitive limits
- **Layer 3 (Core Loop)**: Evolution extends the loop, doesn't break it
- **Layer 4 (Systems Map)**: Evolution adds systems appropriately

## Example: Pixel Pets

```markdown
# Mechanic Evolution: Pixel Pets

## Early Game (Simplicity)

### Core Mechanics
- Basic fusion (2 creatures → 1 creature)
- Simple visual feedback
- Basic collection display
- 10 starter creatures

### Complexity Level
- 2 choices: Which creatures to fuse
- 1 action: Execute fusion
- Simple outcome: New creature appears

### Learning Goals
- Understand fusion concept
- Learn basic creature properties
- Discover visual variety
- Build initial collection

### Constraints
- Limited to 10 starter creatures
- Only basic fusions available
- Simple visual effects
- No advanced mechanics

## Mid Game (Depth)

### New Mechanics
- Advanced fusion (3+ creatures)
- Rarity system (common, rare, epic)
- Visual effect combinations
- Collection categories
- Fusion history

### Complexity Increase
- More fusion options (3+ creatures)
- Strategic decisions (rarity vs. experimentation)
- Collection management (organization, categories)
- Pattern recognition (which fusions work)

### Mastery Goals
- Understand fusion patterns
- Master rarity system
- Optimize collection building
- Discover advanced combinations

### Unlocks
- Rare creatures unlock after 10 fusions
- Epic creatures unlock after 50 fusions
- Advanced visual effects unlock with rare creatures
- Collection categories unlock at 20 creatures

## Late Game (Emergence)

### System Interactions
- Rarity + Visual effects = Unique combinations
- Collection size + Fusion history = Strategic planning
- Visual variety + Rarity = Collection completion goals
- Fusion patterns + Mastery = Optimization strategies

### Emergent Behavior
- Expert players discover optimal fusion paths
- Collection completion becomes strategic challenge
- Visual effect combinations create unique aesthetics
- Fusion history enables predictive strategies

### Expertise Goals
- Master all fusion patterns
- Complete collection categories
- Optimize fusion efficiency
- Create unique visual combinations

### Endgame Content
- Collection completion challenges
- Rare creature discovery
- Visual effect mastery
- Fusion optimization competitions

## Introduction Timeline

## Evolution Triggers

### Unlock Conditions

- **Advanced fusion**: After 20 creatures in collection
- **Collection categories**: After 20 creatures
- **Fusion history**: After 10 fusions

### Milestone Gates
- **Early → Mid**: 20 creatures, 10 fusions
- **Mid → Late**: 50 creatures, 50 fusions, rare creatures unlocked
- **Late → Endgame**: 100 creatures, epic creatures unlocked

### Progression Paths
- **Collection-focused**: Build large collection, complete categories
- **Rarity-focused**: Hunt rare/epic creatures, optimize fusion
- **Visual-focused**: Create unique visual combinations, aesthetic collection
- **Mastery-focused**: Master all patterns, optimize efficiency

### Branching
- Paths diverge based on player preference
- No forced progression, multiple valid strategies
- Different paths lead to different expertise
- All paths enable endgame content

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Front-Loading Complexity

Introducing all mechanics at once:
- **Problem**: Overwhelming, hard to learn
- **Solution**: Introduce gradually, build on foundations

### 2. No Evolution

All mechanics available from start:
- **Problem**: No progression, no mastery
- **Solution**: Gate mechanics, create progression

### 3. Arbitrary Unlocks

Unlocks don't make sense:
- **Problem**: Feels arbitrary, not earned
- **Solution**: Unlocks should feel natural, build on mastery

### 4. Complexity Without Depth

Adding complexity without depth:
- **Problem**: More systems, not more interesting
- **Solution**: Add depth, enable mastery, create emergence

**This layer ensures Cursor designs systems that evolve appropriately, building complexity gradually and enabling mastery over time.**
