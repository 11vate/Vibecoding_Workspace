## Common Loop Patterns

### Collection Loop

**Structure**:
1. Observe collection
2. Identify gaps/needs
3. Acquire items
4. Add to collection
5. See progress
6. Repeat

**Why It Works**: Collection taps into gathering motivation.

**When to Use**: Collection-based experiences.

### Mastery Loop

**Structure**:
1. Attempt challenge
2. Apply skill
3. Receive feedback
4. Improve skill
5. Achieve mastery
6. Repeat

**Why It Works**: Mastery taps into competence motivation.

**When to Use**: Skill-based experiences.

### Creation Loop

**Structure**:
1. Gather materials
2. Design/create
3. Execute creation
4. See result
5. Share/use creation
6. Repeat

**Why It Works**: Creation taps into autonomy motivation.

**When to Use**: Creative experiences.

### Exploration Loop

**Structure**:
1. Explore environment
2. Discover content
3. Interact with discovery
4. Learn from interaction
5. Find new areas
6. Repeat

**Why It Works**: Exploration taps into curiosity motivation.

**When to Use**: Discovery-focused experiences.
