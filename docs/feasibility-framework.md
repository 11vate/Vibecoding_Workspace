## Feasibility Criteria

### Feasible

**Criteria**:
- All technologies available
- Performance targets achievable
- Architecture supports needs
- Constraints respected
- Risks manageable

**Action**: Proceed with design/implementation.

---

### Marginal Feasibility

**Criteria**:
- Most requirements feasible
- Some risks exist
- Alternatives available
- Mitigation possible

**Action**: Proceed with caution, plan mitigation.

---

### Not Feasible

**Criteria**:
- Key requirements impossible
- Critical constraints violated
- No alternatives
- Risks too high

**Action**: Redesign or abandon.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Types

**Technical Risks**:
- Technology limitations
- Performance problems
- Architecture issues
- Integration difficulties

**Constraint Risks**:
- Framework constraints
- Browser constraints
- PWA constraints
- Offline constraints

---

### Risk Mitigation

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Alternative approaches
- Fallback plans

- Contingency planning

**Why**: Mitigation reduces risk impact.

---

## Integration Points

### Design Intelligence
- Informs design decisions
- Guides system design
- Influences feature scope

### Blueprinting
- Validates blueprint feasibility
- Checks technical requirements
- Assesses implementation complexity

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Evaluate

**Evaluate feasibility when**:
- Designing new systems
- Adding major features
