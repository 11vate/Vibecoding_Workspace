- Experience drifts from vision
- Features accumulate
- Complexity increases
- Focus lost

**Why**: Early detection enables early prevention.

---

### Technical Warning Signs

**Signs**:
- Tight coupling appears
- Circular dependencies
- Performance degrades
- Code quality decreases

**Why**: Early detection enables early prevention.

---

**Signs**:
- User confusion increases
- Error rates rise
- Completion rates drop
- User complaints increase

**Why**: Early detection enables early prevention.

---

## Prevention Protocols

### Design Phase Prevention

**During Design**:
- Check against anti-patterns
- Validate assumptions
- Test mental models
- Assess cognitive load

**Why**: Prevention during design is most effective.

---

### Implementation Phase Prevention

**During Implementation**:
- Follow patterns
- Avoid anti-patterns
- Regular reviews
- Automated checks

**Why**: Prevention during implementation catches issues early.

---

### Post-Implementation Prevention

**After Implementation**:
- Monitor for warning signs
- Regular audits
- User testing
- Performance monitoring

**Why**: Ongoing prevention maintains quality.

---
