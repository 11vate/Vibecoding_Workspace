# Progression Design

## Purpose

Comprehensive design of progression systems, ensuring users feel advancement and maintain motivation through well-designed progression.

**Progression is core to engagement. This document enables progression design.**

---

## Progression Types

### Linear Progression

**Type**: Straightforward advancement path.

**Characteristics**:
- Clear path
- Predictable advancement
- Steady progress
- Obvious next steps

**Use Case**: Clear goals, straightforward advancement.

**Why**: Linear progression provides clarity.

---

### Branching Progression

**Type**: Multiple advancement paths.

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple paths
- User choice
- Different experiences
- Replayability

**Use Case**: User agency, variety focus.

**Why**: Branching progression enables choice.

---

### Exponential Progression

**Type**: Accelerating advancement.

**Characteristics**:
- Rapid growth
- Increasing rewards
- Accelerating progress
- Excitement building

**Use Case**: High growth, excitement focus.

**Why**: Exponential progression creates excitement.

---

### Plateau Progression

**Type**: Advancement levels off.

**Characteristics**:
- Growth slows
- Focus shifts
- Optimization phase
- Mastery focus

**Use Case**: Mature systems, mastery focus.

**Why**: Plateau progression enables mastery.

## Progression Design Elements

### Progress Visibility

**Element**: Show progress clearly.

**Design Considerations**:
- Visual progress indicators
- Progress percentages
- Milestone displays
- Achievement tracking

**Why**: Visibility maintains motivation.

---

### Meaningful Milestones

**Element**: Create meaningful advancement points.

**Design Considerations**:
- Significant milestones
- Meaningful rewards
- Clear achievements
- Recognition systems

**Why**: Meaningful milestones create satisfaction.

---

### Appropriate Pacing

**Element**: Pace progression appropriately.

**Design Considerations**:
- Not too fast (loses meaning)
- Not too slow (frustrating)
- Varied pacing
- Context-appropriate

**Why**: Appropriate pacing maintains engagement.

---

### Multiple Progression Paths

**Element**: Enable different advancement styles.

**Design Considerations**:
- Collection path
- Mastery path
- Creativity path
- Social path

**Why**: Multiple paths serve different motivations.

---

## Progression Principles

### 1. Always Progressing

**Principle**: Users should always feel progress.

**Application**: Provide continuous advancement.

**Why**: Continuous progress maintains motivation.

---

### 2. Meaningful Advancement

**Principle**: Progress must feel meaningful.

**Application**: Significant milestones, valuable rewards.

**Why**: Meaningful advancement creates satisfaction.

---

### 3. Visible Progress

**Principle**: Progress must be visible.

**Application**: Clear indicators, milestone displays.

**Why**: Visibility maintains motivation.

---

### 4. Appropriate Pacing

**Principle**: Pace progression appropriately.

**Application**: Not too fast, not too slow, varied.

**Why**: Appropriate pacing maintains engagement.

---

## Integration with Other Layers

### Layer 3 (Core Loop)
- Progression supports core loop
- Loop creates progression
- Progression maintains loop

### Layer 5 (Mechanic Evolution)
- Progression drives evolution
- Evolution creates progression
- Progression enables evolution

## How Cursor Uses Progression Design

### When Designing Systems

Cursor must:
1. **Choose progression type** - Linear, branching, exponential, plateau
2. **Design progression elements** - Visibility, milestones, pacing, paths
3. **Apply progression principles** - Always progressing, meaningful, visible, appropriate
4. **Test progression effectiveness** - Measure satisfaction, adjust

**Never design systems without progression design.**

---

### When Evaluating Designs

Cursor must ask:
- Is progression type appropriate?
- Are progression elements present?
- Are progression principles applied?
- Is progression effective?

**Never accept designs without progression design.**

---

## Success Indicators

Progression design succeeds when:
- ✅ Users always feel progress
- ✅ Advancement is meaningful
- ✅ Progress is visible
- ✅ Pacing is appropriate
- ✅ Multiple paths exist
- ✅ Users maintain motivation
