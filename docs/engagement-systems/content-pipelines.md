## How Cursor Uses Content Pipelines

### When Designing Systems

Cursor must:
1. **Choose pipeline type** - Procedural, curated, user-generated, hybrid
2. **Design pipeline** - Quality, variety, pacing, relevance
3. **Plan management** - Planning, production, delivery
4. **Test pipeline effectiveness** - Measure engagement, adjust

**Never design systems without content pipelines.**

---

### When Evaluating Designs

Cursor must ask:
- Is pipeline type appropriate?
- Is pipeline designed well?
- Is management planned?
- Is pipeline effective?

**Never accept designs without content pipelines.**
