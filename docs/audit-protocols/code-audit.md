# Code Audit Protocol

## Purpose

Systematic protocol for auditing code quality, ensuring code meets standards and maintains quality.

**Code audits prevent technical debt and ensure maintainability.**

---

## Audit Scope

### What to Audit

**Code Elements**:
- Architecture quality
- Code patterns
- Error handling
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Testability

**Why**: Comprehensive audit ensures code quality.

---

## Audit Process

### Step 1: Architecture Audit

**What to Check**:
- Is architecture coherent?
- Are dependencies clear?
- Is modularity maintained?
- Are patterns consistent?

**Output**: Architecture audit results

---

### Step 2: Code Quality Audit

**What to Check**:
- Are coding standards followed?
- Is code readable?
- Are patterns appropriate?
- Is complexity managed?

**Output**: Code quality audit results

---

### Step 3: Error Handling Audit

**What to Check**:
- Are errors handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are failures graceful?
- Is user feedback clear?

**Output**: Error handling audit results

---

### Step 4: Performance Audit

**What to Check**:
- Is performance acceptable?
- Are bottlenecks identified?
- Is optimization appropriate?
- Are resources managed?

**Output**: Performance audit results

---

### Step 5: Maintainability Audit

**What to Check**:
- Is code maintainable?
- Is documentation adequate?
- Are tests present?
- Is refactoring needed?

**Output**: Maintainability audit results

---

### Step 6: Synthesis

**What to Do**:
- Synthesize audit findings
- Identify issues
- Prioritize problems
- Recommend fixes

**Output**: Audit report with recommendations
