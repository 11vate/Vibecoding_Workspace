# Asset Intelligence System

## Purpose

Comprehensive asset management system treating assets as systems, not files, enabling intelligent asset handling.

**Asset intelligence ensures assets are managed systematically.**

---

## Core Principles

### Local-First

**Principle**: All assets must be local, no external dependencies.

**Requirements**:
- Assets in `/src/assets`
- No CDN dependencies
- No external loading
- Offline-capable

---

### Symbolic References

**Principle**: All assets referenced symbolically, never direct paths.

**Requirements**:
- Asset registry required
- Symbolic exports
- No hard-coded paths
- Registry-based access

---

### Indexed Assets

**Principle**: All assets must be indexed.

**Requirements**:
- Asset index created
- Assets cataloged
- Metadata tracked
- Cross-referenced

---

## Asset Types

### Sprites

**Management**:
- Sprite sheets preferred
- Individual sprites indexed
- Metadata tracked
- Registry access

---

### Audio

**Management**:
- Preloaded and registered
- Metadata tracked
- Volume controls
- Playback management

---

### Data

**Management**:
- Structured data
- Schema validation
- Version tracking
- Migration support

---

## Integration Points

### Asset Registry
- Registry manages assets
- Assets accessed through registry
- Registry enables intelligence

### Knowledge Base
- Asset patterns documented
- Asset sources tracked
- Asset wisdom accumulated

---

**This system ensures assets are managed intelligently as systems, not files.**
