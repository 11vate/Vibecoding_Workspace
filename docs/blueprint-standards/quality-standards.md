# Blueprint Quality Standards

## Purpose

Standards for blueprint quality, ensuring blueprints are complete, accurate, and useful.

**Quality standards ensure blueprint effectiveness.**

---

## Completeness Standards

### Required Sections

**All blueprints must include**:
- Purpose (clear and specific)
- Scope (boundaries defined)
- Inputs/Outputs (all documented)
- Data Structures (complete definitions)
- State Management (transitions documented)
- Dependencies (all identified)
- Failure Modes (all documented)
- Edge Cases (all identified)
- Performance Considerations (requirements specified)
- Scaling Paths (evolution planned)

**Why**: Completeness ensures nothing is missed.

---

### Enhanced Requirements

**Enhanced blueprints must also include**:
- Tuning Parameters (all documented)
- Performance Characteristics (measured)
- Scaling Paths (detailed)
- Evolution Hooks (identified)
- Failure Modes (enhanced)
- Monitoring Points (specified)

**Why**: Enhanced requirements enable better implementation.

---

## Accuracy Standards

### Data Accuracy

**Data must be**:
- Correct (accurate information)
- Current (up-to-date)
- Validated (checked for correctness)
- Consistent (no contradictions)

**Why**: Accuracy ensures reliability.

---

### Design Accuracy

**Design must**:
- Align with requirements
- Match design intelligence layers
- Follow patterns
- Respect constraints

**Why**: Design accuracy ensures feasibility.

---

## Clarity Standards

### Documentation Clarity

**Documentation must be**:
- Clear (easy to understand)
- Complete (all information present)
- Organized (logical structure)
- Accessible (easy to find)

**Why**: Clarity enables effective use.

---

### Structure Clarity

**Structure must be**:
- Consistent (same format)
- Logical (makes sense)
- Navigable (easy to navigate)
- Searchable (easy to find)

**Why**: Structure clarity enables efficiency.

---

## Validation Standards

### Pre-Implementation Validation

**Before implementation, blueprints must**:
- Pass completeness check
- Pass accuracy check
- Pass clarity check
- Be approved

**Why**: Validation prevents problems.

---

### Post-Implementation Validation

**After implementation, blueprints must**:
- Match implementation
- Be updated if changed
- Document deviations
- Record lessons learned

**Why**: Post-validation ensures accuracy.
