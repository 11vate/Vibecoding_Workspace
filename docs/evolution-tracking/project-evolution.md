## Evolution Patterns

### Linear Evolution

**Pattern**: Steady, predictable growth.

**Characteristics**:
- Consistent additions
- Predictable changes
- Steady improvement

**When It Works**: Clear vision, stable requirements.

---

### Exponential Evolution

**Pattern**: Rapid, accelerating growth.

**Characteristics**:
- Rapid additions
- Accelerating changes
- Exponential improvement

**When It Works**: High growth phase, strong foundation.

---

### Plateau Evolution

**Pattern**: Growth levels off.

**Characteristics**:
- Slowing additions
- Stabilizing changes
- Mature state

**When It Works**: Mature project, optimization phase.

---

## Evolution Metrics

### Growth Metrics

**What to Measure**:
