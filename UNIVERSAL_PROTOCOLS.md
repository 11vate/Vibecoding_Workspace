# Universal Protocols for Ultimate Design Intelligence Workspace

## Core Operational Principles

These protocols apply to all AI models engaging with this workspace:

### 1. Design Intelligence First (Prime Directive)
- All development follows the hierarchy: **Experience → Systems → Data → Code**
- Never reverse this order
- Never implement without proper design reasoning
- Always start with the "why" before the "how"

### 2. Research Before Design
- Conduct comparable system research before any design work
- Generate research artifacts in `/docs/research/`
- Cross-reference knowledge base before inventing
- Document findings and implications

### 3. Blueprint Before Implementation
- Generate formal blueprints before writing any code
- Use templates in `/tools/blueprint-templates/`
- Validate completeness using `/tools/validation/blueprint-validator.md`
- Store blueprints in `/docs/blueprints/`

### 4. Quality Gates (Zero Tolerance)
- No placeholders, mocks, or speculative code
- No hard-coded values (use configurable parameters)
- Type safety required (strict TypeScript mode)
- Error handling for all edge cases
- Accessibility considerations mandatory
- Performance optimization required

## Framework Constraints

All projects must follow these constraints:

### Technical Constraints
- Web-native: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript only
- PWA-first: Progressive Web App with offline capability
- Vite-based: Standard build tooling
- Local assets only: No external API dependencies
- No proprietary engines: No Unity, Godot, or other engines
- Offline-capable: Service workers, local storage, IndexedDB

### Architecture Constraints
- Follow canonical project spine structure
- Modular, self-contained systems
- Event-driven architecture
- Centralized state management
- Core loop: Input → State Update → Side Effects → Render

## Operational Workflow

### 4-Phase Development Process
1. **Research Phase**
   - Compare with existing systems
   - Analyze successful patterns
   - Document failure cases
   - Create adaptation strategy

2. **Design Phase**
   - Apply 15-layer Design Intelligence Stack
   - Create multiple design concepts
   - Explain tradeoffs
   - Cross-reference knowledge base

3. **Blueprint Phase**
   - Generate formal system/UX/mechanic blueprints
   - Define data structures and state transitions
   - Document all edge cases
   - Validate blueprint completeness

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Code exactly as specified in blueprints
   - No deviations without blueprint updates
   - Follow coding standards and patterns
   - Apply continuous quality gates

## Documentation Protocol

### For All AI Models
- Use `@Docs` to reference workspace documentation
- Use `@Codebase` to reference existing code
- Create new documentation as design artifacts
- Maintain consistency with existing docs
- Document decisions, not just implementations

### Document Hierarchy
1. `experience-pillars.md` - Core fantasy and purpose
2. `player-psychology.md` - User motivation and feelings
3. `core-loop.md` - Central experience mechanism
4. `systems-map.md` - System interdependencies
5. `mechanic-evolution.md` - Growth over time
6. `ux-decision-log.md` - Justified UI/UX decisions

## Knowledge Base Integration

### Before Creating Anything New
1. Check `/knowledge-base/mechanics-library.md`
2. Review `/knowledge-base/ui-pattern-library.md`
3. Consult `/knowledge-base/progression-systems.md`
4. Examine `/knowledge-base/economy-models.md`
5. Search `/knowledge-base/references/`

### Pattern Application Process
1. Find similar patterns in knowledge base
2. Adapt (don't copy) the successful elements
3. Document how the pattern fits this project
4. Add new successful patterns back to knowledge base

## Quality Assurance Protocols

### Self-Auditing Process
Regularly (or when requested):
1. Audit for system redundancy
2. Identify unused mechanics
3. Check for cognitive overload
4. Detect feature creep
5. Recommend removals before additions

### Continuous Validation
- Validate blueprints through simulation
- Cross-reference all design decisions
- Apply error handling to all paths
- Optimize for performance and accessibility
- Ensure offline capability

## Communication Protocols

### When Engaging with Users
1. Explain the "why" before the "how"
2. Reference appropriate documentation
3. Show respect for design intelligence process
4. Maintain consistency with workspace philosophy
5. Educate on research → blueprint → implementation workflow

### When Handing Off Work
1. Document current state and reasoning
2. Provide context to next process
3. Maintain architectural consistency
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Cross-reference design intelligence docs

## Error Handling Protocols

### If Violating Universal Protocols
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain the violation
3. Return to appropriate phase
4. Follow correct protocol
5. Document the correction

### Common Violations
- Skipping design intelligence layers
- Implementing without blueprints
- Adding placeholder code
- Using external dependencies
- Violating framework constraints

## Success Criteria

The universal protocols succeed when the AI model:

### Operates as Design Intelligence
- ✅ Automatically researches before designing
- ✅ Generates blueprints before code
- ✅ Cross-references knowledge base
- ✅ Reasons from experience → systems → code
- ✅ Maintains architectural consistency

### Maintains Quality Standards
- ✅ Produces no placeholders or speculative code
- ✅ Follows all framework constraints
- ✅ Implements with proper error handling
- ✅ Optimizes for performance and accessibility
- ✅ Ensures offline capability

### Demonstrates Understanding
- ✅ Explains reasoning behind decisions
- ✅ References appropriate documentation
- ✅ Applies design intelligence layers correctly
- ✅ Maintains consistency across projects
- ✅ Follows 4-phase development process

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- Works with current `.cursorrules` (now universal operational law)
- Compatible with 15 design intelligence layers
- Integrates with 40+ tools and systems
- Follows canonical project spine structure
- Maintains existing quality gates

### With Knowledge Base
- Accesses all existing pattern libraries
- Contributes to accumulated wisdom
- Cross-references all existing content
- Maintains consistency with established patterns
