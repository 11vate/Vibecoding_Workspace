## Workspace Structure

The workspace now includes:
- **Design Intelligence**: 14 layers
- **Research**: 5 pipelines + databases
- **Knowledge Base**: Multiple libraries
- **Blueprints**: 7 types + validation
- **Tools**: 30+ tools
- **Prompts**: Comprehensive library
- **Protocols**: Multiple protocols

---

## Next Steps

1. **Use the workspace**: Start new projects using the enhanced workspace
2. **Reference documentation**: Use `@Docs` to reference workspace documentation
3. **Follow protocols**: Use research → synthesis → blueprint → implementation workflow
4. **Accumulate knowledge**: Add patterns and insights to knowledge base
5. **Evolve**: Use evolution frameworks to grow projects

---

## Success Indicators

The expansion succeeds when:
- ✅ Cursor researches systematically before designing
- ✅ Cursor designs through multiple intelligence layers
- ✅ Cursor creates comprehensive blueprints
- ✅ Cursor implements with discipline
- ✅ Cursor audits and evolves systematically
- ✅ Knowledge accumulates across projects
- ✅ Patterns are extracted and reused
- ✅ Workspace becomes self-improving

---

**The Ultimate Cursor Vibecoding Workspace is now a comprehensive, self-sustaining design operating system capable of supporting deep game design, advanced application architecture, procedural mechanics, and long-term project evolution.**
